00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.400
GITA WIRJAWAN: Hello, friends, 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.550
today we have with us
 Dr. Tirta Mandira Hudhi. 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.480
Tirta, thank you so much for coming. 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.370
TIRTA MANDIRA HUDHI: I’m honored 
to be invited, Mr. Gita.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.840
I usually just watch your lectures online, 
but now I get to be here in person.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.750
You're a very smart guy. Tell us what it 
was like growing up in Solo

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.460
your background, so people can understand 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.240
how you became such a reader and 
how you developed your thinking.    

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.420
One privilege I used to deny,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.240
I used to deny it. Back in 2014,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.310
I would always say I came from nothing.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.800
But I started accepting the truth 
around 2021, 2022.   

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.840
And my biggest privilege 
was education. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.770
My parents were both educators. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.440
My dad was an economics lecturer
 at a university in Indonesia.  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.710
But due to income needs, he had to 
pivot for financial reasons 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.440
he left his job after 9 years 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.840
and became a banker at a 
rural bank in Central Java.   

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.040
My dad is a native Javanese,
 from Sambi, Boyolali. 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.350
Our family name is Wongsodimejo. 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.950
His name is Sutarjo,
you can check, it’s real.   

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.370
Another privilege. in 1998, 
my dad was invited 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.930
by President Habibie to a meeting 
as an economic expert 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.950
to discuss the financial crisis.   

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.510
He was that serious 
about math and finance. 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.910
That’s something I never 
really shared before,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.970
but there’s a photo.   

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.800
My mom, on the other hand, 
studied agricultural science. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.020
She’s of Chinese descent, from 
Wotgandul in Semarang. 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.710
She graduated cum laude
 in agriculture from UNS.   

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.330
She used to be a teaching assistant, but because 
her younger siblings needed financial support, 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
she switched careers and became
 a banker. Imagine that.   

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.510
From science to banking. Back in elementary 
and middle school, I thought that was normal. 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.350
But in high school, once science and 
social studies were separated

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.020
I realized it wasn’t.  So, yeah, she graduated in agriculture,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.530
actual agriculture, not agricultural 
technology, from UNS, 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.660
and ended up in banking.   

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.110
Both my parents were born in 1958 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.260
and met at a library. 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.220
So they were both book lovers.   

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.110
-Which city? 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.910
-Surakarta.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.710
They met in college and 
eventually had me. 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.080
They only wanted one child.  

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.150
Because my dad calculated it-

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.770
-Barely enough? 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.460
-Yes,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.570
They were middle-class. Not poor, 
not rich—right in the middle.   

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.130
My dad was the second child, 
my mom the eldest. 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.530
My dad’s Muslim, my mom’s Catholic. 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.020
And I don’t know— don’t want to know,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.170
I don't know how they got married. That’s their business.   

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.200
So yeah, that’s my privilege. 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.930
My dad had an entire room just 
for books—a full library.   

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.770
Back in elementary school, he once
 gave me a thesis to read.   

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.000
That’s where my reading habit started. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.730
My dad began talking to me seriously 
when I was in first grade.   

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.750
He always said, 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.840
“I’m a middle-class guy. I sent you to a 
Catholic school, Kanisius Keprabon 2,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.930
where your classmates are all from 
rich families, kids of entrepreneurs.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.930
I can’t afford tutoring until 
you’re in third grade, 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.110
so the only thing you can 
do is study hard. 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.840
What brings pride to our family 
is your academic success.”   

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.730
That’s what he told me. 
You can ask him directly,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.400
he’s still working, still a banker,
 refuses to retire.  

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.130
He says retiring would 
make him senile. 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.730
His words. And that kind of 
talk shaped me to believe

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.130
that academics were everything

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.420
that it was the way to bring
 honor to the family.  

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.350
I was raised like that from first grade. 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.930
I ranked 9th at first—then 9th, 7th, 6th.   

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.840
By second grade I started understanding, 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.400
and I begged my mom for a tutor. 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.660
Eventually they gave in and got
 me one tutor—for math. 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.550
By second grade I ranked 2nd. From third grade 
until high school, I was always ranked 1st.  

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.640
A big reason for that was 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.950
being able to go to my parents’ workplaces.   

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.840
Since we were middle-class 
and couldn’t afford a maid, 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.820
after school I was picked up by a 
pedicab driver named Mr. Nuri.   

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.930
I still remember everyone who helped me, 
his name was Mr. Nuri. 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.410
Shoutout to him. He’d take me 
to my mom’s office at Pasar Legi.   

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.010
My mom was a banker at a small branch
 of a private bank in Pasar Gede.   

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.170
That’s where I’d do homework 
and math exercises,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.570
hang out with her coworkers, 
and observe what she did.   

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.860
So yeah, companies that allow employees 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.950
to bring their kids to work end
 up raising kids like me.   

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.220
Shoutout to those kinds of directors. 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.530
My mom’s boss allowed it.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.880
 “It’s okay, bring your child.”   

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.730
So I’d spend about three hours in 
that office—from 1 PM to 4 PM. 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.130
After that, I went to tutoring,
 then headed home.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.350
I was fully independent from 
second to fifth grade.   

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.440
My parents gave me clear goals. 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.950
I didn’t even own a Tamagotchi.   

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.460
If I wanted a PlayStation 1, 
I had to hit a certain rank.   

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.530
My dad never broke his promises.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.600
He always said, “These goals aren’t for me, 
they’re for you."

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.480
"If you’re not smart, you won’t
 get into college. 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.640
And the only way to lift our family’s dignity 
is through academic achievement.”   

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.950
And I internalized that.   

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.370
By fifth grade, I was representing my
 school as a model student.   

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.570
Back in elementary, there were contests like the 
Olympiads and model student competitions.   

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.020
Since I was ranked 1st from grade 4 to 5,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.880
We only switched to semesters in grade 5. I was
 born in 1991, and before that, we had trimesters.   

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.080
Anyway, I entered the model
 student competition.   

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.860
I still remember—I had two teachers:
 Mrs. Ati and Mr. Suryo.   

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.880
Mr. Suryo was the math teacher.  

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.660
I never forget my teachers.  

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.260
I ended up 3rd place in the city.   

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.330
1st place was from SD 15, 2nd from SD 16, 
those were the famous schools in Surakarta.  

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.140
3rd place was me, from SD Kanisius.   

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.440
At that time, I really believed that being 
smart would get me scholarships.   

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.950
Dunkin Donuts used to give free 
donuts to the top 3 students.  

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.780
No joke. I loved that program.  

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.710
- Sugar rush.   

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.860
-I didn’t realize that at the time, 
I was just a kid.   

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.780
Because I stayed in the top 3 
from grades 1 to 6, 

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.860
I got a one-year scholarship to Pangudi Luhur 
Bintang Laut for junior high.   

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.260
That school’s on Slamet Riyadi.   

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:43.040
In 7th grade, I ranked 1st again.   

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.510
-I also went to Pangudi Luhur for
 junior high, in Jakarta, Haji Nawi.   

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.580
-Ah, then you’re familiar.   

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.840
In 8th grade, I ranked 1st again. 
So yeah, during that early phase,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.290
Hope it’s okay I’m going into detail. 
Don’t want netizens to get the wrong idea.   

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.330
In that early phase, my parents 

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.290
gave me clear academic targets 
starting at age 7.   

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.020
But there was a downside, 
which I’ll get into later.   

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.710
In junior high, I could still handle it.   

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:17.690
In 8th grade, I joined three Olympiads,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:23.000
math, science, and English.   

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.330
Thanks to those, I was offered a
 scholarship to Saint Joseph College.   

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.800
I passed, but didn’t go, living
 expenses were too high.   

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.890
I also got a scholarship to Regina Pacis, a year 
later at the Ursuline school in Solo.   

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.840
There, I kept ranking 1st, 

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.860
and eventually made it into the 
top science class, IPA 1.  

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.040
I didn’t join the international standard school (RSBI)—
it didn’t exist for my generation. 

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.600
RSBI came after me.   

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.800
That’s when the conflict with 
my parents started.   

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.730
The downside of all those targets hit 
in high school, I was burned out.   

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.690
I rebelled. I hated it.   

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.800
I felt like I was studying just 
to please my parents.   

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.840
So I acted out.   

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.820
Got in trouble. I still remember 
my principal, Sister Floren.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.890
She called my parents in all the time.  

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.550
So there I was, in the top class, academically
 gifted but with a bad attitude.   

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.110
Always in trouble, fighting with teachers, 
fighting with classmates, 

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.820
constantly getting called in.   

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.980
Until one day, my dad had
 a serious talk with me.   

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.660
He said, “It’s up to you. Whatever you 
want to be, that’s your choice.”   

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.150
Then I ran away from home 
to a friend’s place.   

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.490
And what did my friend do?
 Took me to Gramedia.   

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.950
So dumb, honestly. Sorry, Mr. Gita.   

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.530
He took me to Gramedia, and
 that’s where I read a book 

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.400
called A Child Called ‘It’.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.350
The author was Dave Pelzer.  
 I still remember the author.   

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.530
There were three books.   

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.530
In the third one, I read about this kid 
who was abused by his mom,   

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.750
then in the second book, he survived, and 
in the third, he forgave her. It was wild.   

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.840
You can read the book by Dave Pelzer, 
A Child Called It. It’s a trilogy.  

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.180
In the third book, he becomes a 
pilot and forgives his mom.   

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.660
Because yeah, she was still his mom.   

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.710
That’s when I started to realize that the 
reason my parents set targets for me   

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.950
was for my own good, not theirs.  

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.620
 In 9th grade, I joined Ganesha 
Operation (a tutoring center).  

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.540
That was my first time doing tutoring 
and meeting kids from public schools.  

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.280
That’s when my point of
 view started to shift.  

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.620
Turns out they were really open-minded,   

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.820
and they were surprised,   
“Why are you in tutoring?”  

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.420
“Aren’t Chinese kids in Solo 
usually not into tutoring?”   

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.000
That’s what they actually said, 
it was hilarious.   

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.550
The GO center was in Kota Barat.   

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.330
I joined because I was curious, 
what’s the national exam really like?   

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.730
Eventually, I chose the GO 
class that made me think,   

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.640
“Okay, maybe I do want to 
go to a public university.”   

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.936
There was a three-way debate. My dad 
went to UNS, my mom went to UNS.   

00:12:11.936 --> 00:12:15.970
They were worried about me going to 
a public university because I’m Chinese.   

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.110
I argued with my dad, “Dad, you’re indigenous
 and you got married just fine.”   

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.060
He went silent.   
Sorry, Dad.   

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.220
That was the first time I talked 
back, and my dad didn’t get mad.   

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.480
“Okay, if you want to go to a public
 university, it has to be a good one.”   

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.930
Okay. 

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.920
So I set a goal, my first choice was the med school at Undip.   

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.230
-Masya Allah.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.980
-Undip med school, but not through,   

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.120
-Why medicine?   

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.940
-Because my mom’s from Semarang.   

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.580
-But why medicine specifically?

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.050
-Because I wanted to aim high. In SNMPTN 
or other entrance exams,   

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.100
medicine always had the highest cutoff.   

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.980
-Cool.   

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.470
-My ego was through the roof. 
I needed validation.   

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.320
As an only child whose life revolved around
 academics, I constantly needed such validation.   

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.780
-Did that come from within,   

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.410
or was it more about the 
culture at home?  

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.940
 -More the family culture. My dad and 
mom always drilled into me   

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.360
-That you had to be the best?  

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.010
-Always the best, because only 
then would people respect you.   

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.810
That was one of our family values.   

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.650
-More from your dad or your mom?   

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.450
-For academics, definitely my dad. 
He was all about that.   

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.520
My mom was more like, “It’s okay,” 
laid-back, accepting.  

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.340
But my dad was strict. 
“If you’re not the best,   

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.700
you’re wasting your potential.   

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.920
You’ve got a brain , use it.   

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.100
You’re my only child, so you’ve 
got to be the best.”   

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.940
At the very least, if not academically,
 then in something else.   

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.300
So I was like, “Alright, I’ll be the best,” 
and that brainwashing

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.450
 led me to pick medicine.   

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.160
I applied to three places: 
Undip, UGM, ITB.   

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.210
Electrical engineering was the hardest.  

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.960
I got accepted into Undip, not through SNMPTN, 
but through the independent exam,   

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.520
which had 120 Olympic-level questions. 
I was at fourth place, and I got in.   

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.050
We found out from my mom’s friend, who turned 
out to be a professor of agriculture at Undip.   

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.160
He let us know I got accepted, 
and I was thrilled.  

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.270
Meanwhile, my school Ursulin 
had no connection with UGM.   

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.850
So I had to submit the documents 
to UGM myself.   

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.960
In public schools, they have a B2B channel   

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:34.500
where students submit their documents 
together through the school.    

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.450
But since Ursulin didn’t have that 
kind of access to UGM,   

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.450
I had to carry the documents around myself.  

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:44.030
I wanted UGM not because it was 
better, no, it was the buildings.   

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.960
The Radiopoetro building, 
I still remember it.   

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.230
I went there for a math Olympiad
 in 12th grade,   

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.050
my last competition in the first semester.  

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.700
I was blown away by UGM’s campus.  

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.940
I chose Undip med school because
 my mom’s from Semarang.   

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.670
But I applied to UGM because I had 
that Olympiad there. I didn’t win.  

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.210
I lost to a kid from Padmanaba, 
SMA 3 Jogja. Badly.   

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.810
I was ranked 6th, he was 2nd.   

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.450
Didn’t make it to the provincial level.   

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.230
I still remember, math Olympiad.   

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.810
I lost by two questions. So frustrating.   

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.810
But the building was awesome.   

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.670
So I thought, “Wow, this place is cool,
 Radiopoetro, just like this.”   

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.560
And in the end, I applied and got into UGM.   

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.180
But I wasn’t satisfied, I also applied to 
Undip med school and to ITB.   

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.520
I wanted to test myself.  

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.520
I also got accepted to seven private universities.   

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.270
Flexing. My ego was still huge.   

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.810
Getting into med school was the 
third big turning point in my life,  

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:45.520
because once I was there, I realized there were 
way more smart people than I expected.  

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.870
I met kids from Insan Cendekia,   
they were next level smart.   

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.670
The Incen kids. And the TN kids.  

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.010
They had those cropped haircuts.  
The girls had short hair,   

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.010
and they were insanely smart.  

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.520
I used to think Tirta was the only one,   

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.980
Young Tirta with a 4.0 GPA 
until the 4th semester.   

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.540
Nope. 60% of FK students had all A’s
 for four semesters at UGM.   

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.250
And the most intense competition,
 I can name the top five schools.  

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:14.920
-Masya Allah.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.450
-TN, Incen, SMA 8 Jakarta,
 3 Semarang, 3 Jogja.   

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.700
Then the ones who would stir 
things up in class discussions,    

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:33.120
3 Bandung, then 70 Jakarta,   

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:43.050
Labschool Rawamangun, 1 Teladan, and another
 one I forgot, I think from Surabaya.   

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:49.430
So the culture in public universities 
completely changed me.   

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:56.580
Before, my parents set the expectations.   

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.610
I finished high school thinking smart
 people always succeed.  

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.900
Because like I said earlier, my 
dad brainwashed me 

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.720
to believe that smart people 
always win in life,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.760
so I had to be smart to raise
 my quality of life.  

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.410
Then I’d be successful.  

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:24.070
And in high school, “success” meant
 a lot of money and such. 

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.630
But in med school, there were just so 
many smart people, and I hit a reality check:   

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.010
doctors don’t make money right away.   

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.410
3.5 years of theory, now it’s 4 years by regulation.   

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.976
2 years of clinical work, 1 year of internship,
 then 2 years of work, 

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.216
5 years for specialization, 
that’s 14 years total.   

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.030
-Wow.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:47.050
-In semester 3, I hit a wall.   

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.580
So mentally, honestly, even before Gen Z was
 talking about it, I was already burned out.  

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.100
“This is bad.” That’s when I started to be more 
realistic, having talks like this with my parents.   

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:04.500
The third core value in our family. 
First, academics. Second, having goals,   

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.630
always being goal-oriented.   

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.430
Third was openness.  

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.630
We’d have three-way discussions every month.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.230
I’d speak honestly,   

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:19.720
“Dad’s 50, Mom’s 50, in 
five years you’ll retire.   

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.700
Your pension could end up paying for my specialization,
 which costs 15 million per semester.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.700
No income for five years. I’m their only child, 
and that’s assuming I succeed.   

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.210
If I don’t earn my own money, our 
family finances could collapse.”   

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.270
-Wow.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.700
-That’s when I got real. I learned to 
be realistic in med school.   

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.580
And then I made a big decision.   

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:51.030
In semester 2, I started selling 
stuff on Kaskus.  

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.340
I sold Power Balance, Blackberries, 
and it worked.   

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.520
Sorry, they were illegal Blackberries,
 I sold those back then.   

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.250
Got them from a reseller, 
packaged them myself,   

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.650
and used the money to save up for tuition.   

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.940
UGM tuition was cheap, just 2.2 million 
per semester. I still remember.   

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.520
It wasn’t a legal entity yet back then,
 so it was still subsidized.   

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.500
So I paid the 2.2 million myself,
 even my rent.   

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.340
My parents only gave me pocket money.   

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.210
Eventually, by semester 5, I was 
covering everything on my own.  

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:30.520
Young guy, 4.0 GPA, earning his 
own money. My ego was massive.   

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.096
Then it got crushed. 

00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:34.090
I applied four times to be a teaching 
assistant and got rejected every time.   

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:40.180
Biochem, rejected. Pathology anatomy, 
rejected. Anatomy, rejected.   

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.410
Totally crushed. My ego was shattered again.   

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:47.340
What always crushed my ego was
 being around smart people.   

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.430
When I’m around less smart people, 
my ego gets huge , every time.   

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.540
And eventually, with all that,
 I realized I’m an only child.   

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.030
I had to make money.   

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.230
I dove into retail.   

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.340
Selling shoes, dealing with people.   

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.320
And then I met my professors. And again,
 it was teachers who changed me.   

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.500
I met three of them:   

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.850
The late Prof. Iwan , he contributed 
a lot during COVID.   

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:20.210
He also helped get Novomix 
covered by BPJS, I think.   

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:29.470
Second was Dr. Denny , he’s a professor 
of physiology at UGM.   

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.410
Third was Dr. Gofir, a neurologist.   

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.470
All three told me the same thing:   
“You’ve worked in sales,   

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.520
you’ve done retail, met lots of people.   

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.140
Doctors take care of patients, 
so who takes care of doctors?”   

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.780
That hit me. Because to doctors, the
 coolest thing is holding a scalpel.   

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:56.500
I loved emergency cases.
 I loved general surgery,   

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.900
digestive surgery, orthopedics,  

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.810
anything involving a scalpel, 
I loved the adrenaline.   

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:08.050
And for doctors, holding a scalpel is the 
sexiest thing. Like, seriously cool.   

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.340
But all three professors told me 
to go into management. 

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:24.230
That made me think. I graduated with 
a 3.8 GPA. Internship. Loved the ER.   

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:30.320
After finishing my internship in 2016,  
someone gave me advice,  

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.140
and I made the biggest decision, 
 to bury my dream, man.   

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.850
The dream of becoming an orthopedic surgeon,
 a surgeon in general, I buried it in 2016.   

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.120
Because I saw my dad aging   

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.780
and I asked him seriously, like if 
Mr. Gita here were my dad ,   

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.580
and I’m the kind of guy who 
can’t sugarcoat things,   

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.900
I asked, “Dad, if your savings are 
used for my specialization,   

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.180
does that mean you and Mom 
won’t get to enjoy retirement?”

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.070
No. 

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.720
Then I said, "I can earn money now, 
my life is settled here. 

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.160
Why don’t you just spend the money 

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.250
to visit countries you’ve never been to, 
because you deserve that. 

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.920
I’ll make my own money." 

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:32.410
At first, they couldn’t accept it. We didn’t argue, 
but it was my mom who accepted it. 

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.270
So I got my mom’s blessing. 

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.340
"It’s okay if you’re happy earning money, 
that’s fine. I’ll talk to your dad." 

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:43.920
So in 2016, I started practicing
 until 2017. 

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.470
In 2017, I buried my dream of becoming 
a practicing doctor.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.340
Because I realized that if I stayed selfish
 about pursuing specialization,

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.500
I wouldn’t give my dad who was already 
58 the chance to enjoy his life. 

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.870
My dad was 58 at that time, 
nearing 60, already retired. 

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.160
If I used up his savings for my specialization 
and specialists don’t get paid, you know  

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.470
I’d become a specialist, but my dad would 
never get to go abroad in his whole life.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.430
He once tried to get a scholarship, 

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.940
I don’t know what it was called back then, 
but his TOEFL score was only 200. 

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.140
My dad couldn’t speak English. Bad. 
Super thick accent.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.450
Even worse than mine. 
His simple past tense was terrible. 

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.050
He never traveled abroad in his life. 

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.030
The first time my dad ever went 
overseas was when he was 60.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.780
If I had been selfish about my specialization,
 I would’ve become one, 

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.650
but my dad would never have traveled. 

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.230
I had to be realistic. I’m not a 
sandwich generation, 

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.270
but they’re already elderly, 

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:51.920
and they’ve never even seen another 
country in their whole lives? 

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.960
My dad still doesn’t dare go on a hajj pilgrimage
 because he’s afraid the money will run out.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:01.740
In the end, I’m the one paying for it 
hopefully this year, if not next year. 

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.050
After convincing him.  

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.470
-But at the time, did it never cross your mind to 
look for a scholarship or something like that?   

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.320
-No, because I was embarrassed 
by my friends. 

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.500
I had three friends. 

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.850
In med school, that’s where my ego got hit the 
most. Med school changed everything. 

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.010
Getting into a state university changed me. 
I met someone named Dr. Sunardi, sir. 

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.780
You could invite him here. 
Dr. Sunardi’s dad was a gravekeeper. 

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.100
He has a PhD though. 

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.920
He came from a poor background. 
Got all his scholarships. 

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.780
To make ends meet, he used to 
summarize lectures, 

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.780
then sell the summaries in a magazine. 

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.210
Summaries. He sold them to other students 

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.830
so they didn’t have to print slides 
 just read the summaries he made. 

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.650
He graduated late because he joined research 
projects so he could keep getting paid. 

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.030
I met a lot of people whose 

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.160
parents were worse off than mine. 

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.670
I’d feel ashamed to take a scholarship
 while my friends  

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.580
well, it’s like this: my parents could still afford 
things, and I could still earn money. 

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.010
But my friends’ parents were 
in worse shape financially.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.580
If I forced my ego at that time,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.320
 I’d feel like I was taking someone else’s 
opportunity. That was a dilemma for me. 

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.450
So I decided, I think I can still 
make it on my own. 

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.080
Earn my own money. 

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.060
That’s why I never dared to take 
a scholarship, even until now. 

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.240
Because I still feel,
“I can still afford it myself.”  

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.990
So because I was making money, I buried my 
dream and focused on managing people. 

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.960
When I turned 25, that was 
my fourth big change.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.880
I got famous. 

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.670
Something I never imagined. 

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.056
By the time I was 26, I started getting
 invited to seminars in Jogja 

00:25:49.056 --> 00:25:51.050
because my shoe cleaning business
 was booming. 

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.240
And I was a doctor, so I got 
invited to universities. 

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.420
My Instagram hit 100,000 followers.
 Instagram became active in 2013, 

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.400
and I started personal branding in 2017. 
My ego was high. 

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:10.790
By 2020, I became the “dr. Tirta” that Mr. Gita knows, 
all is wrong in my eyes. 

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.980
Why did I think everyone was wrong? 

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.020
Maybe netizens or even Mr. Gita,
 hearing me ramble, would think, 

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.180
“Oh this kid’s never really 
struggled in life.” True. 

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.310
I was used to being number one. I was 
always number one. I was an only child. 

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:29.120
I got into med school easily, could earn money, I could sell. 

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:37.350
But I got hit hard because of fame and my inability 
to take advice from people on social media. 

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.040
In 2020, I think back now, and that version 
of Dr. Tirta was really arrogant. 

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.670
And I only realized it because
 of a life event.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.880
I was cycling far, met someone who helped me,
 I gave him money and he threw the money.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.500
“Not everything is about money, bro.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.540
I helped you because we’re on the same road. 

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.550
Your bike is more expensive than my truck,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.160
but what good is it on the road?” 
I went silent. 

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.060
That happened twice in Indramayu.  

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.580
Hit me hard. While riding from Indramayu
 to Simpang Jomin, I thought, 

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.720
“Man, I’ve been such an idiot all this time.” 

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.980
I changed because I met a truck 
driver whose name I still don’t know  

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.300
helped me for 50 kilometers. 

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.200
He said he helped me because 
he thought I was a ghost.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.960
I was cycling, he lit me up from behind 
with his headlights. 

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.070
Then he said, “I’ll keep the lights on for 
50 kilometers, my house is ahead,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.820
but don’t give me money. 
I don’t need your money. 

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.190
We’re on the same road, 
we should help each other.”

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.340
I still remember his words, 

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.820
“People who live on the road 
must help each other.” 

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.440
That shattered me. Cracked my ego. 

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.000
When I got home, I still remember, it was March 2022, 
I immediately registered for ITB. 

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.400
Something I never liked, management.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.340
I needed acceptance, sir. 

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.420
My lecturers, the late Prof. Iwan, 
dr. Gofir, and dr. Denny  

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.960
had been asking me to focus on 
managing people since 2016. 

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:10.340
I didn’t listen to them for six years, 
and it takes me 6 years to finish the study. 

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.540
At ITB, I met more brilliant people. 

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:20.000
I met two generations at once, mentors
 like Bu Nila, Bu Yuni Ros, Pak Yos. 

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.350
I’m the type of person who
 always looks up to mentors. 

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.180
And I met Gen Zs who are just 
unbelievably smart. 

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.070
Some were 24 and already had a
 master’s degree. Like, how? 

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:32.760
Their GPA in undergrad was 3.9, and I asked, 
“Why do you want to get a master’s?”

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.630
“Because I still feel dumb at work.” 

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.760
“You’ve only worked a year and you already 
feel dumb and go back to school?”

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.600
“Yeah, my dad can afford it.” 

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:47.560
There I was, meeting two different 
generations. I changed again, I evolved. 

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:53.580
Turns out smart people never stop reading, 
even after getting degrees. 

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.190
The difference between smart and 
intelligent people is  

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:02.040
if someone thinks they’ve made it because
 they have a degree and they stop reading,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.510
that’s where their knowledge stops.  

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.390
My mentors were willing to listen to me. 

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.510
They saw me as a resource.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.480
 I was shocked. I was still in 
my master’s program. 

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.600
That’s when I realized  oh, this is what separates 
people who go on to do a PhD. 

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.600
I still remember my lecturer, 
her name’s Bu Nila. 

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.080
She’s amazing. Same age as me,
 already a PhD by 27. 

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.560
She said to me, “Tirta, don’t get cocky, okay?
 I’m gonna show off, Tirta. 

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.980
Come on guys, Tirta is 31, 
owns a store, right? 

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.700
I got my PhD at 27. 
Where were you at 27, Tirta?” 

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.950
Oof, I surrendered. 

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.760
They teased me, but I loved it because 
there were people smarter than me. 

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.230
And smart people always explain 
things so clearly. 

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.240
Thanks to Bu Nila, I became super 
focused on data. 

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.500
I don’t want to say anything I don’t fully 
understand anymore. 

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.360
Because of her, I now only focus 
on three things: 

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:05.500
health, knowledge, and business 
&amp; marketing strategic analysis  

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.500
because I really love those fields.  

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:13.070
From Bu Yuni Ros, who taught HR, 

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:18.340
She instilled in me the idea 

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.420
that if you stop learning, 
your career is over. 

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.670
Knowledge is everything. 

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.980
Sure, you’re a doctor, but if 
you learn this well, 

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.280
you can get two things. 

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:37.220
In healthcare, you have the foundation, 
but every doctor manages patients  

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.750
you can manage the doctors. 
That hit me hard. 

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.940
Finally, from Pak Yos  he said to me, 

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.960
“Money spent on education is not 
an expense, it’s an investment.” 

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.790
I graduated from ITB with a GPA of 3.9. 

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.830
I was supposed to give the graduation speech 
as the most inspiring graduate. 

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:05.110
I still remember, it was Pak Yos who chose me 

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:12.780
to speak at Hotel Intercontinental Bandung. 

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.460
But I didn’t want to speak, sir. 

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.400
Because I told him, there's still someone-

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.230
Here’s where my ego finally softened 

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.470
“Tirta, you’re speaking, you’ll represent the graduates.” 
The reason I refused was... 

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.720
I have the chat history where I declined 
to represent the graduates. 

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:36.440
Because I felt there was someone 
smarter than me, his name is Nelson. 

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.470
He spoke seven languages, 
had a GPA of 3.99, sir. 

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.560
At ITB

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.270
I felt he was more worthy than me
 to represent the students. 

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:49.800
And they accepted that.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.950
So from that long story I’ll sum 
it up into five things.   

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.350
My parents instilled the importance 
of setting targets,   

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.500
that without knowledge, you won’t 
understand the world.   

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:08.460
And knowledge can elevate your status, that’s true, 
but it doesn’t guarantee success.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.980
In high school I learned to 
control my ego.   

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.800
I hit rock bottom, fought with my parents, came 
to understand that the targets they gave me  

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.700
were actually targets meant for myself, and  
 in high school I felt arrogant.   

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:29.360
In college I realized that 
reality doesn’t align with   

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.800
what my parents had taught me, that  
 knowledge is indeed important   

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.780
but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll 
be 100% successful.   

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.430
Because you don’t have the same privileges  
 as your other friends.   

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.060
You’re an only child, you can’t choose 
where you’re born.   

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:47.580
So you have to sacrifice your dreams 
for something bigger.   

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.990
During the pandemic I learned 
 about popularity.   

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.840
Turns out, smart and successful people   

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.550
who can’t control their egos
 will fall apart.   

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:06.460
And their egos will lose to people who 
 may not be academically smart,   

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.470
but through experience, they’re 
more important.   

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.780
So this fourth lesson I really learned.  

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:17.830
We can learn not only from smart people, 
not only from the wealthy.   

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:23.180
We can also learn from people who 
may be below us financially,   

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.510
but above us in terms of wisdom.   

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:29.430
That was the fourth thing I learned, from 
 a truck driver who gave me a lecture.   

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.590
At ITB I learned that life-long learning  
 is everything.   

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.060
Which brings us back to number one.   

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.240
So these five phases shaped 
who I am now   

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.510
and maybe at 40 I’ll learn 
something new.  

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.190
It’s from these things that I believe

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.430
Without my parents, there wouldn’t 
 be the version of me today,   

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.040
because my parents burdened me  
 with targets.   

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.240
Without my rebellious self in high school  
 I wouldn’t be who I am today.   

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.440
Because I knew my ego was huge in high school, 
I was a rebel, defiant, opposed everything.   

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:08.220
Without my professors at FK UGM,  
 I wouldn’t have learned how to face reality.   

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.280
Without the life event 
 that happened while cycling,   

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.120
my ego wouldn’t have crumbled 
 for the second time.   

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.390
So my ego fell twice, once in high 
school, and recently.   

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.030
Without my teacher at ITB I wouldn’t 
understand books.   

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.350
And maybe there will be other life events.   

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.220
This is the culture that I think 
exists in my family.   

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.160
Open to knowledge.   

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:43.300
Knowledge can come from books, professors, other 
experiences, self experiences, articles, papers.   

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.100
People who don’t keep learning are missing out.   

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.750
Even if we don’t grow financially,   

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.280
with knowledge we’ll tend to 
  make better decisions.   

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.760
And these five things are
 what made me who I am.   

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.660
Yes, my IQ is 148. My IQ is right there.  
 I’ve taken the test three times.   

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:06.270
141, 142, 148. My TPA 
score is over 600.   

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:11.300
But that means nothing if it’s not 
put into real action.   

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.460
I’d just be a smart person 
doing nothing.   

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.340
That’s why I said to my father,  

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.310
 If I don’t use social media
 for health education  

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.800
in normal language   

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.590
or to share my views 
 on education,   

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:35.540
then people will keep thinking doctors are 
just like that—wearing white coats, strict.   

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.360
They’ll think that 
 healthcare is expensive. 

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.800
If my dad weren’t a professor,  
 I wouldn’t be like this, Sir.   

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.040
-There are a few points I want to respond to,  

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.680
but first I’d like to share 
 a few data points.   

00:35:54.100 --> 00:36:00.870
Based on your experience, what 
 do you think can be done to 

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:06.300
raise the average IQ of Indonesians?  

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.240
Our IQ, if I’m not mistaken, is 78.9.   

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:18.580
Secondly, what makes a lot of people in 
Indonesia anxious is our PISA score.  

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:25.560
PISA measures STEM and literacy skills 
of 15-year-old students.   

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.230
Indonesia’s score ranks 
 69 out of 81 countries.   

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.280
Singapore is number one.   

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:36.540
China has now fallen behind Singapore, 
down to number two.   

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:47.830
Now, third, I’m listening to you, and you’re 
clearly a very confident storyteller,   

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.880
and I often talk about the importance
 of all of us in Indonesia  

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.670
being better storytellers.   

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.300
-Oh yes, I remember 
 your lecture, Mr. Gita.   

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.740
-In the international community 
 we’re not well known.   

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.520
The ones more recognized are 
Indians as storytellers.   

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.870
In Southeast Asia, maybe
 Singaporeans. 

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.680
I think the positive attributes you have 
can really be spread more widely.  

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.390
First, to help raise IQ.   

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.110
Second, hopefully boost 
 our PISA score.   

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.630
From 69th, maybe even to number one, 
or number five, or at least top 10.  

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:38.640
 In Southeast Asia, only two countries 
are above the global average:   

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.200
Singapore and Vietnam.   

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.110
-Oh really?   

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.190
Vietnam is catching up,
 I read that recently.   

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:49.080
-Yeah, so like Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines,
 Indonesia, all below the global average.   

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.600
The global average PISA score is 
488 if I’m not mistaken.   

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.910
Now, third, how do we become 
storytellers like you?   

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.830
-This question sounds like
 it’s from a professor.   

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.020
-But yeah, I’ve been 
 teaching for quite a while.   

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:09.270
But when I was a student,  
 I thought it was harder,   

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.120
-It’s harder being a professor.   

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.110
-It turns out teaching is much harder, 
the prep and everything.   

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.920
but you learn more from your students
 than they learn from you,  

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.780
in my opinion. That’s real.   

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.630
Oh, so what my professor, 
Bu Nila, said was true, huh?   

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.460
-Absolutely, I really relate to that.   

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.790
-She said learning doesn’t 
 have to come from professors.  

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.790
 I also learn from listening 
 to all of you.   

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.150
-I completely, completely agree with that.  

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.240
 -So, to raise IQ I think the challenge 
 comes in three parts:   

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.660
ourselves, our environment, 
 and lastly, the government.   

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:52.160
First, I say it starts with us, 
 personally, it’s about habits.   

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.480
We lack the habit of reading.   

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:02.820
We lack reading habits because 
we lack libraries in schools.   

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.480
And reading is associated 
 with academic books.   

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.710
In my opinion not others’, 
just mine, disclaimer

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:16.340
The books that should be read from an early age 
are not academic books at home,   

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.480
but books of knowledge.  

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.180
Because that’s what I do with my child.   

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.500
And reading books today doesn’t have to 
mean physical books, there are e-books.   

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.180
Give them books on an iPad, 
not just YouTube.   

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.560
If the kid doesn’t want to read, then
 give them scientific content on YouTube.   

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:39.630
Because books tell stories. If they’re 
 still in kindergarten, then comics or fairy tales. 

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:44.000
The more often they read, what’s 
developed in their minds   

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.790
is continuity in critical thinking.   

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.800
Why did this happen? 
It happened because of this.   

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.710
Why are our kids like this?   

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.070
Because they’re used to memorizing,
 not thinking critically.   

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.960
That’s what I’ve criticized 
from the beginning.   

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.870
My privilege at Kanisius Elementary, a Catholic 
school, was that I wasn’t told to memorize.   

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.480
I was told to understand. Shoutout to 
 Kanisius, Pangudi Luhur, and Ursulin.   

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.630
Not saying others don’t do this.   

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.380
Among Muslims there’s Muhammadiyah 
 and Insan Cendekia. 

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.800
The folks at Insan Cendekia are extraordinary.
 All of them are geniuses.   

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.670
So from what I see, proper high schools, 
be they Islamic, Catholic, Christian, or whatever,   

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.660
they make students understand, 
not just memorize.   

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.590
That’s number one.   

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.950
Environment. Now this part,   

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.100
my privilege is that my parents 
were educators.   

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.360
-That’s amazing.  

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:40.790
That’s something I can’t expect 
 from every family.  

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.230
So this second point may 
 or may not be doable.   

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.640
But I’ll offer this suggestion to 
parents with Gen Alpha kids.   

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.400
That means parents in my generation, 
or your kid’s generation maybe.  

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.200
 Those born after 2010.  
 Or, after 2014.   

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:05.070
So now they’re around  
 10 years old. Talk to them.   

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.560
Why? Because your kids—  

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:13.270
just because they’re children doesn’t 
mean they don’t understand.   

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.230
The difference between kids and 
adults in medical terms is

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:21.620
kids can’t respond yet, but  they
 understand what we say.   

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:29.430
So if you talk to a baby, they  
 understand what you’re saying.   

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:34.980
And children are copycats 
of those closest to them.   

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.510
So if your kid swears a lot, it clearly 
comes from the parents.  

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.360
 If the parents aren’t around, then  
 it’s their circle. Kids are copycats.   

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:51.430
So, talk to them, and because 
kids are super curious,   

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.120
let them know where your money 
 comes from. 

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.840
What changed me in elementary school was 
when my parents took me to their office.   

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.240
So I knew what my mom and dad 
 were doing to earn money.   

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.820
That’s what I’m doing  
 with my kid now.   

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.540
I take my kid to the office, 
 "Look, this is what your dad does."  

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.350
"When I’m at the hospital, this 
is how doctors work."   

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:21.280
And eventually it helps them understand  
 that life requires money.   

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.590
And the kid will feel respected  
because you talk to them often.  

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.700
So they learn vocabulary 
  from their parents.   

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:33.430
Now, what I see in some parenting styles,  
 "Have you studied? Do your homework!"   

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:39.070
"Ugh, you’re so annoying! Dad’s
 tired from work, be quiet!"   

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.390
So kids don’t get a chance  
 to talk. What’s the result?   

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.240
When they grow up, they won’t 
  have the courage to speak up.   

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.550
That’s why not all Indonesian
 kids become storytellers, Sir.   

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.440
Because even in their own families  
they aren’t given the chance to talk.   

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.720
They say a word and it’s, "Always arguing! 
You’re a disrespectful child!"   

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.360
When they were just starting to talk...  

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.880
So kids, because they still can't
 tell right from wrong,   

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.910
they're very vocal, innocent.   

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.030
It happened to my friend's kid   

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.820
"Is this the uncle who always says weird stuff, 
like 'jancok-jancok' on YouTube?"   

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.070
Whoa, dang.   

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:21.720
After that, I started covering my tattoos because
 my friends’ kids were starting to criticize me.   

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.080
It showed up on TikTok, "Mr. Tirta, Mr. Tirta, 
your hair used to be pink."  

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.600
I didn’t think much of it before, but 
turns out I was influencing them.   

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.580
So, that’s number two.   

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.472
Number three, if we’ve already got number 
one, which is the habit of reading, 

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.128
family environment, and government.   

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:45.080
What’s most important from the government
 is to change our education system  

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.680
not just chasing rankings or whatever, 

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.110
but making sure education quality
is equal across the board. 

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.980
Whatever the method, I believe the experts know,

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.230
PhDs, policymakers.   

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:04.180
But from my experience giving guest lectures, 

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.080
the quality of education is still all over the place. 

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:17.550
As long as we’re still comparing public and private schools, Java and Papua, 

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.560
the gap of knowledge is going to be huge. 

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.540
If we want to move forward as a country 
and aim for the golden generation in 2045, 

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.420
the budget should be used to 
level out education quality 

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.580
from Sabang to Merauke. That’s it, problem solved. 

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.630
But it’s a long journey. 

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:38.310
Education takes at least 12 years, so let’s say President A 

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.740
gets elected 

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.400
and their focus is human capital, the 
results will only be seen 12 years 

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.400
later when those kids graduate high school. 

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.040
The one started won’t see the outcome. 

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:57.780
It’ll be the president after them 
who reaps the benefits.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:02.580
If they serve two terms, 10 years, they’ll still 
be the ones building the foundation. 

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:06.390
If we focus on human capital, 
the results will be clear. 

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.700
Look at Japan, Korea, Finland, Europe,
they invested in people. 

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:14.700
But the impact isn’t immediate. 
It takes 12 years. 

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.270
Now, do we have the guts to
 stay committed to that? 

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:21.740
That’s what I talk about
with friends in politics. 

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:26.280
It’s hard, because it’s not something you 
can turn into a quick campaign promise. 

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.980
People judge a leader’s success
 by what they can see.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.700
And education? It’s not visible. 

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.510
Tangible projects are easier to 
sell, you can touch them, see them. 

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:45.960
Education is an intangible investment. You’ll only 
see the results 12 years down the road. 

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:51.740
Now, if point number two is met, but
 point three isn’t, you’ll have a mismatch.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.060
Some people will have an IQ of 140,
 others will be down at 50. 

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.720
That’s what happened. Why is the 
Indonesian average 78? 

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.720
Because there are only a few outliers.   

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:05.980
So the smart ones are the outliers. Those at 
the bottom are scoring 50, 70.   

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.990
Because they don’t know what to do,   

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.310
and the one who can make that 
happen is the government.   

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.680
Not just the minister, but the leader.   

00:46:17.152 --> 00:46:21.360
The leader, down to the governor, 
then to the regent, the mayor  

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.680
there has to be a clear roadmap.   
“Come on, let’s sit down together.”   

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:30.600
“If we don’t standardize education, 
it looks like we’ll collapse in 2036.   

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.520
We’ll topple over. So, what do we do?  

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:39.400
Okay, we’re from different parties, bro. 
Come on, I have a roadmap,

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.680
but this roadmap can’t be implemented  

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.390
I’m using youth slang here, Sir   

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:48.240
this roadmap can’t be implemented 
by me, it’ll be harvested by you.   

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.380
Whoever wins. But let’s align first, shall we? 
Let’s run this roadmap together.”   

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:59.320
Every time we change leaders,
 the roadmap changes.   

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.580
Every time leadership changes, the education 
policy changes, it's confusing. 

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.430
PBDB just changed yesterday, then
 it’ll change again, and again.   

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:08.080
And that constant change is what 
stresses the teachers out.  

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.660
And we haven’t even talked about teacher 
salaries, contract teachers, and so on.   

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.910
We’re only talking about the roadmap.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:18.790
So in my view, as someone 
who’s benefitted from education,

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:26.580
as someone with that privilege, this is what I think 
will raise our PISA scores and national IQ.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:32.040
-So, how can we improve storytelling skill? 

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:39.990
-That’s the second point.
 Parents of Gen Alpha,

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.500
let your kids talk.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.640
They’re not being disrespectful,
 they’re not talking back. 

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.630
My dad gave me the freedom 
o express my opinions 

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.430
no matter how weird they were and
 he never shut me down. 

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.880
He debated me.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.000
Sometimes our discussions
 would go on for four hours.   

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.560
What was the longest argument 
about? Buying a car. 

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.580
In my third year of high school, my 
dad wanted to buy a Grand Livina. 

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.190
I said no, because it only seats five.   

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.280
“But why?”   

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.280
Well, my dad loved going on 
road trips, so I told him, 

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.430
“Get a 2000cc car instead.” We went back 
and forth for a month. 

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.950
In the end, we got an Innova, 
which was perfect.

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:24.460
It’s not that the Livina was bad, 

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.150
but the point is, after a whole month of 
debating, my dad considered my opinion. 

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.220
As a kid, I felt heard. 

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.750
Kids stop telling stories when 
they feel like no one listens.   

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.480
So eventually, they shut down that storytelling
 skill as they grow older.   

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.440
And when they speak in public, 
they show this typical trait,

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.990
The typical trait of a child who's never
 been given a chance to speak

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.030
"Come on, speak in public!"

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:51.400
They go, "Uh... um... well... uh..."   

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.220
That means, in their family, they were never 
given the space to express themselves.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.720
Most of the time, parents say things like,

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.190
"Oh please, what do kids know?" 
That’s super annoying.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.120
People say, "What do you know, 
you're just a kid!"   

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:08.560
Or "You’re too young to be part 
of adult conversations!"  

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:13.140
Or "Don’t argue, just listen!"   

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.510
But parents aren’t always smarter.
 What if the child is a prodigy?  

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:19.630
-That’s how you kill their potential.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:22.840
-Yeah, so if you as a parent  

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.200
don’t give your child the 
space to speak,  

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.910
they’ll never grow up becoming 
a storyteller

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.340
unless they’re lucky enough to find an 
environment that supports them.   

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.280
Like if they’re in a community 
that pushes them to speak,   

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.280
they might end up becoming 
a skilled storyteller. 

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.190
That’s why, when I look around,
 I start noticing patterns,

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.040
Indonesia’s notable public figures tend to have fathers
 with at least a master’s or doctoral degree.  

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.120
-Let me add to that,

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:57.480
If we look at the numbers in 
Indonesia, 88% of households   

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:02.210
are led by someone without 
a bachelor’s degree.   

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:11.320
93% of eligible voters don’t hold
 a university degree.   

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.840
So if we’re hoping that, like you
 just said earlier,   

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.530
the home ecosystem 

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.690
when 88% of heads of households
never went to college, 

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.180
they likely don’t even have a clear idea 
of what meaningful education looks like.    

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:36.340
It’s tough to expect a culture
 of reading,  

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:41.240
a culture of storytelling, to grow
 under those conditions.   

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.730
That’s why I think, this is just 
based on my intuition,

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:52.970
maybe the only way to disrupt 
education is through schools.   

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:59.370
And in schools, we must make sure 
 that the teachers are high-quality.  

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.400
-Agree.

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:05.410
-But too often, we focus on curriculum,
 or on technology,   

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:11.040
and not enough—sorry to say—
on teacher quality.   

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.810
I truly believe that if a teacher
 is a great storyteller,   

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.784
even if they don’t fully understand physics, 

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.192
they’re more likely to inspire 
students to become physicists.   

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.690
Compared to someone who does understand 
physics, but can’t tell a good story.   

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.560
-Exactly.   

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.340
There are smart people who can’t teach, 
but there are ordinary people who can

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.080
teach so well that they make
 their students brilliant.   

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.120
-I can name some of my own 
teachers in 9th grade, 

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:41.580
in middle and high school. 
They didn’t always

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:46.610
fully master the subject, but they 
were amazing storytellers.   

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.660
They sparked imagination—
more than just memorization.   

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.820
I agree with you. Memorizing isn’t the goal.   

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.050
Imagination is what really matters. 

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:04.690
Looking forward, if we want to 
become a great nation,   

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.720
then schools must* highlight   

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.120
the importance of high-quality educators.   

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.100
Because many homes won’t be like yours. 

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.340
- Exactly. That’s privilege.  

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.020
-Where the parents expose their 
kids to workspaces, 

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.020
so you understand business.   

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.690
Or they push you to debate,
 to argue constructively.   

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.620
But most families don’t do that.  

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:38.050
-Yeah, which is why I fully agree with you, Mr. Gita. 
 That’s the privilege I had.   

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:38.640
-Yes.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.690
-I completely agree. School is key.   

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.840
There’s a viral take on TikTok that said,  
 “School is just unemployment with style (college).”  

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.050
But in truth, school doesn’t make us smart,

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:52.520
school trains us how to think.   

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.770
And I really agree, a decent school

00:52:55.770 --> 00:53:00.160
is determined by teacher quality, and 
teacher quality is determined by salary.    

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.860
And here’s where we’re stuck 
in a vicious cycle.   

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:06.380
If we want quality teachers,   

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.540
we have to raise their salaries, so that they know,

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.320
“Oh wow, being a teacher actually pays well.”    

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.540
That’s the key difference between us 
and developed countries.   

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.300
Teachers and lecturers there earn big salaries.    

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:22.260
I think it’s a chicken-and-egg situation.  

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:22.640
-Exactly.  

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:31.690
-Do we raise salaries first, or do we look
 for quality teachers first?   

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:32.880
“Can we do both at once, Doc?”   

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.800
But developing quality teachers takes time.   

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.040
That’s the chicken-and-egg problem.  

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.240
-I think salaries must be raised first. 

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.840
- Okay. I’m not entirely sure.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.980
- Mistakes in recruitment will still happen, 
even though the salary has been raised.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:53.660
But it's difficult to attract or curate 
qualified teachers

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:56.100
if their salaries aren't increased, right?     

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.340
-Salary first? 
-Yeah. 

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:01.370
And I see the countries that 
excel in education are 

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:03.810
Singapore, South Korea, and China.     

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:09.160
But in South Korea, they truly compensate teachers

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:14.500
as if they were working at Amazon,
 McKinsey, or any top company.     

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.130
And secondly, social status.     

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.980
So when a student just graduates, 

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.280
and they tell their parents in the village,    

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:29.560
"Mom, Dad, I got four job offers, 
here, here, here, and here,     

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.740
but I chose to become a teacher 
at Seoul National University."     

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:37.170
The presumption is that the 
compensation is good,  

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:41.460
But secondly, the parents will say, 
"That's amazing, child."     

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.810
-Oh, is this in South Korea? 

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:45.100
-Yes, they are highly respected.     

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:47.360
-In South Korea? 
-Yes, in South Korea.     

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.660
And this is manifested in the 
education products.

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:57.160
I often tell the story that in high school in Seoul, 
students who graduate from that school    

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:05.540
have perfect SAT scores, Scholastic Aptitude Test, 
750, oh sorry, 1600.    

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.940
-So that’s almost genius level, right?

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:07.820
-Yes.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.980
-So if they graduate from there, they can 
go to UGM, Caltech, Princeton, 

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:18.860
Oxford, based solely on academic 
scores, they’ll definitely be accepted. 

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:19.720
-That’s tough.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:27.180
-That’s South Korea, because they recruit 
people from the top 5 percent     

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.320
of all higher education to teach anywhere, 

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.740
from kindergarten, elementary school, 
junior high, senior high, to university.     

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:41.660
In Singapore, they recruit 20% from the top.    

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:50.360
I don’t see how we can become really great 
if we don’t take a stance like that.     

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:55.880
-This is a new perspective for me. 
A perfect SAT score is tough. 

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.410
-Yes, it's achieved by a 
high school in Seoul,     

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:05.610
everyone who graduates from
 there has perfect scores.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.490
It’s unimaginable, and if we go 
to top schools in America,    

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:12.800
in the UK, Korean people,

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.970
 even though their population is 
only 50 million, we have 280 million.     

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:23.020
And this has already manifested in 
their products like

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.460
LG, Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, and others.    

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:34.130
- This is a new perspective. One of the 
subjects at ITB talks about innovation,

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.420
The difference between truly intelligent
 people is they love invention.     

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:42.780
We’re lacking inventors, we lack discoverers.     

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:48.210
An inventor can become one if they 
meet a really great teacher.     

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:51.180
I’m not discrediting quality,     

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.730
because, again, I totally agree with Mr. Gita,
 the salary has to be increased first     

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:58.010
so teachers and educators have more budget     

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:59.720
for improving their lifelong learning.     

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.520
-Correct.     

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:05.210
If we offer them decent salary, 
the ants will come, right?

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:06.320
-Yes, where there’s sugar, there are ants.     

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.060
-Yes, some ants are good, 
some aren’t, right?     

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:10.810
We'll curate them later.    

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.900
But if we don’t increase it, 

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.580
the ants will go to 
 McKinsey, Citibank, Amazon.    

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:18.520
Right?    

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.040
-Yes.

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.000
-And in my opinion, the only 
disruption that can be done 

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.770
is through schools.     

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:31.580
Can you imagine if the teachers in 
schools teach like your parents?

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.290
There would be millions of Tirtas.     

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:36.400
-Yes, I agree. 

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.290
-Then, it goes to pesantren, synagogues,
 mosques, churches, 

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.770
cafes, the discussions, the dialectics
 would be of such high quality,    

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.220
like you’re debating about the car.     

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.680
It would highlight perfection, 
the superlatives, 

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.300
What's the best. 

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.170
The focus would be on ideas, 
not events, not people.     

00:57:58.930 --> 00:57:59.610
But ideas. 

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:06.450
If that’s done in social institutions, 
in schools, offices, households, 

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:11.700
cafes, clubs, it would become something. 
Nation building. 

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:19.100
-That’s in line, Sir, because my PhD topic

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.370
is about people knowledge, 
Knowledge People Management.     

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.480
The only way to improve the capability of
 Indonesia’s Gold Generation 2045     

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:32.010
is by improving HR capability.     

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:36.640
When our human capital increases, the 
human development index will rise,     

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.640
and GDP will also increase.     

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.680
But if we— and the quickest
 way I totally agree,    

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.730
is that the golden generation will happen in 2045,     

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.880
which will be the generation of 
my children, Alpha children.    

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:56.890
If our generation’s education
 system still struggles 

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:01.000
to get a teacher salary increase 
  and quality teachers,

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.040
then 2045 will only be enjoyed 
  by a handful of people.     

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:10.340
And it’s like if we, as marketers,
 have a huge market,    

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.560
but the conversion will be small.     

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.850
So yes, 2045 will happen, 
  but maybe only for 0.05%.     

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:21.080
So only a small number of HR will break through 
the capability that has privileges,     

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.220
maybe their parents are like mine,     

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:27.210
or like Mr. Gita and others.    

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.650
So, I agree with that,     

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.580
but it depends. Teacher salaries are 
 dependent on the third factor,     

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.120
public policy.    

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.520
Government policies or 
 regulations, the rules     

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:52.240
about teacher selection, teacher salaries, 
so that eventually society gets 

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.480
the same educators from Sabang to Merauke,     

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.520
and in the end, their level of 
thinking will be better. 

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:05.760
So, something as simple as 
why myths and facts,     

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.490
and health myths or hoaxes are believed?     

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.440
Because they can't think critically. 

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.000
-Oh, yes.

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:16.560
That’s a characteristic of postmodernism,     

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.660
where kids nowadays don’t read books,    

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.260
because they don’t stick to the facts, 
 they’re quicker to form opinions.     

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.360
And when they form opinions,
 they can’t differentiate     

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:37.530
between opinion and fact.     

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:46.300
And that’s very real, and this correlates with     

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.020
the polarization of conversations.    

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.080
-Yes, right.     

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.720
There’s an echo chamber on the right, 
 and one on the left,     

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.130
they can’t intersect, or interact, or communicate.     

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:02.680
- Because they were taught from the start 
that differing opinions are wrong.     

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.100
So they can’t accept various 
 differences, and in the end,     

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.520
"Oh, if you’re different from me, 
you’re wrong, you’re my enemy."     

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:13.880
So it keeps polarizing, A and B.     

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.680
So if I say I don’t like oranges, 
“Oh, that means I’m an enemy of oranges.”     

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.400
That’s happening now, right?     

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:26.970
And this polarization happens because 
 there’s no critical thinking pattern,     

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:30.130
“Oh, differences are normal. 
Different opinions are fine,”     

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:31.490
as long as there’s evidence.     

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:35.540
If you’re going to express an opinion, it has to 
have evidence. Otherwise, don’t give your opinion.     

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:41.060
And don’t give an opinion outside your
 field, because it will be biased.     

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.300
That’s actually taught since elementary school.     

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:50.530
True, my second privilege, is that my parents
gave me proper education,    

01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:51.900
that’s why I am what I am now.     

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:59.220
-Your parents are extraordinary educators, 
who, if it could be cultivated    

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:02.730
or institutionalized in all institutions,     

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.940
not just schools, not just 
pesantren, not just churches, 

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.440
not just synagogues, not just mosques, 
not just offices, or anywhere.     

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:16.860
So your discussions or discourses at 
home should be replicated 

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:22.320
across all institutions so that the quantity
 of this is more visible.    

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.850
 And for a country with 
280 million people,

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:34.240
we need to think about how we can 
compete with China and India.     

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:42.020
And they don’t hold back, when they 
send people to universities, 

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.940
they send to the best places in the world. 
In the US, there are 400,000 from India.     

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.820
From China, 400,000.   

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.410
From Indonesia, only 8,500.     

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:58.800
China sends 200,000 to the UK. 
Indonesia only sends 4,000.     

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.370
Yes, they can send students to UGM, 
 ITB, Undip, and others,     

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:06.970
but they chase innovation,    

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:14.420
and technological innovation is still 
abundant in Europe and America,     

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.550
and now it’s starting to show in Japan, 
Taiwan, South Korea, and China.     

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:26.080
But in Southeast Asia, I see now  
 the most eager to pursue knowledge 

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.570
was Singapore, now it’s Vietnam.     

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:35.660
And we can easily see that the most 
foreign students in South Korea 

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.240
used to be from China, now it’s Vietnam.     

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.040
Because it’s cheaper to study
 in Korea than in the US, 

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.460
cheaper than in Europe, 
cheaper than in Japan,     

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.510
cheaper than in China.     

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:53.440
And their technological innovation is amazing. 
Go study there.     

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.130
-Because innovation is something 
that will be the future.     

01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:01.820
Because what we sell now, I think,

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.510
disclaimer, this is my subjective view,     

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:07.170
because it’s usually spun, 
I’m used to it.     

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:09.280
So, for example,     

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.860
Our country is large, we’re still selling 

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.910
raw materials or semi-finished goods.     

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:27.820
Secondly, we’ve become the basket size 
for foreign companies,    

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.680
 We’re only seen as a number,     

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.840
"Wow, Indonesia has 280 million, their minimum wage 
is this, sell soap packets, it’s sure to profit."     

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:40.440
But we forget to look that we also
 have a market abroad.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:47.310
And the only way is by sending
 people to study abroad.

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:50.510
And we hope that many Indonesians

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:54.930
I actually hope that smart people work in foreign 
companies until they become CEOs,

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.420
So don’t just pull the smart ones back. 
I actually really want

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:04.460
a CEO from Indonesia, like at Microsoft.     

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:07.200
That would be a game changer. 
 - Amen. Amen.    

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.600
But if before they become CEO,  
we pull them back here, then it’s over.     

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.680
So we’re not unpatriotic.     

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.620
Nationalism is when 
one of our best talents    

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:22.510
leads a multinational company. 
Even International company. 

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:27.150
And when we pull them back, they’ll 
spread that culture of innovation.     

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:32.770
But if we only become a commodity, pulling them back 
while they're stepping up the ladder, 

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:34.080
that won’t work.     

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.220
-I once said,     

01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:41.910
Can you imagine if the CEO of Microsoft 
was named Bambang?     

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:47.220
If the CEO of Google was named Komeng?     

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.930
-Wow, that would be terrific!

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:55.420
-That would be more nationalist, because
 the values they or the diaspora 

01:05:55.420 --> 01:06:00.020
can pour into Indonesia are insane.   

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:05.840
And if Google or Microsoft comes here,
 led by someone like Bambang or Komeng, 

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.110
they’d be thinking of making huge investments, 
not small-time stuff.   

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.040
Right? 
–Absolutely. Totally agree.  

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:18.330
-And that’s what I often bring up in the
 context of brain circulation 

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:21.040
or brain linkage, not brain drain.   

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:28.310
It’s totally fine for them to go abroad, gain knowledge,
 build their careers over 10, 20, 30 years,   

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:31.950
but if they can make it to the top
 of their Everest,   

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:37.860
I’ve said this before too –
 that’s what needs to be supported   

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.330
so Indonesians can reach
 the top on the world stage.   

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:49.530
But that’s not going to happen if the average IQ is 78.9, 
if our PISA ranking is 69 out of 81.   

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:53.880
If we can’t tell stories the way you do.  

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.880
– So this is no longer a micro issue, right?   

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:02.260
– It’s extremely macro. And here’s the thing, 
when I’m abroad and I line up people

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:07.860
from countries A, B, C, D, E, then there's India. 
Everyone’s cognition is the same.   

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:11.240
But the ones who can really tell
 a story are the Indians. 

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.020
–That’s why they end up as CEOs, 
why they gain trust, right?   

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.040
– Because they can tell a story, and 
they’ve got the cognitive skills.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.860
- Smart people who can tell stories.  

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:22.710
- Yes.

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:26.840
– And if we had one or two CEOs 
in international companies, 

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840
that would boost Indonesia’s image 
and global trust.   

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.150
People would start to think, “Turns out 
Indonesian talent is just as good.”   

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.110
And that’s what we’re lacking.   

01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:38.200
That’s why I’m one of those who 
agree if someone’s already abroad,  

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.640
"Fine, but prove yourself there. 
Build your career to the top.   

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.930
Like some of my peers who are doctors.   

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.420
There’s Mas Giovanni van Empel in Australia, 
pr another friend of mine in Japan.   

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.950
When they return to UGM, 
they actually teach.   

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.950
Just teach, then go back abroad.   

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.000
People look up to them, “Wow, that’s cool!”   

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.570
And more people are getting 
motivated to go to Japan.   

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:04.000
Japan’s a top destination, especially for
 cardiology and internal medicine.   

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.770
My friends go to Japan because others 
before them went to Japan.   

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:09.260
Others go to Europe because they followed 
people who studied in Europe.  

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.480
“Why didn’t Tirta go?”
 Well, I missed the boat.   

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.600
But one day, I still want to go. I still have
 a shot at getting a master’s.   

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.950
And for me, education is never limited by age.  

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.860
 It’ll never be limited by age.  

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.170
 And I agree with you, Pak Gita, 
there’s no other option   

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:26.880
but to send educators abroad.   

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.150
I actually wanted to comment on this
 “But UGM’s not bad!”   

01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:31.480
True, it's not bad.  

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.970
But most global innovators come from-

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:39.730
- I really respect schools in Indonesia,   

01:08:40.150 --> 01:08:42.280
but if we’re looking at global rankings,   

01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:48.020
Indonesian universities are still ranked
 in the 200s and up.   

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:54.000
If we really want to seek knowledge, we go to 
the top-ranking schools, right?   

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.820
Not that we shouldn’t go to the 200s.   

01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.060
We can go there too, but we also need 
people to aim for the top-ranked ones.   

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:06.110
That’s what we need to make part of 
the culture. Don’t think so narrowly,   

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.480
like what we have in this country
 is already enough.   

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.220
We need openness. Education, in my view, 

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.820
needs to be deeply rooted in openness.   

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.550
Without openness, we can’t innovate   

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:23.230
or evolve into something or someone better.   

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:29.120
And you’ve been successful as a student, 
successful as a doctor,   

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.340
successful as an entrepreneur, 
and successful as a storyteller.   

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.540
Right?   

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.050
That shift from medicine to 
entrepreneurship is incredible.   

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:43.630
Now I want to go back to the 
health dimension.  

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.660
I want to talk about mental health issues.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.140
From what I’ve seen in Surgeon General’s Reports 
from developed countries,   

01:09:54.140 --> 01:10:00.400
the most worrying diseases nowadays 

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.420
aren’t heart disease, diabetes, 
or stroke, but depression,   

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.980
anxiety, even suicide.   

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.800
Earlier we were chatting casually   

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.320
about Jonathan Haidt’s book, 
&lt;i&gt;The Anxious Generation,&lt;/i&gt;

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.980
where he puts forward the 
hypothesis or even theory that   

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.750
this is linked to excessive online activity   

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:32.490
and a lack of offline activity.   
What do you think about that, Tirta?   

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:38.060
– When you mentioned Jonathan Haidt, 
that aligns with medical papers.   

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.440
Yes, technology is like a double-edged sword.  

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.070
The upside is, it can take us to the
 highest point of innovation.   

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:52.600
But the downside is, it makes 
us spend more time 

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.830
in the tech world than in our 
real surroundings.   

01:10:56.010 --> 01:11:01.740
That’s especially clear with our generation, 
and those younger than me.   

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.920
Why is Gen Z more vocal about 
mental health issues?   

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.520
Because most of their lives have already 
been exposed to tech,   

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.720
they’re used to expressing 
themselves on social media.   

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.104
The peak was during the 2020 pandemic. 

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.888
Gen Z was in their productive years 
either in high school, college,

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.600
or starting their careers.   

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.320
That early Gen Z cohort, born 
around 1998 to the 2000s,   

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.700
most of them in 2020 were in 
their 5th or 6th semester.   

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.380
And just like that, everything got cut off. 
Online learning.

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:40.140
led to a spike in their screen time,  

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:46.270
 and that led to skyrocketing anxiety.   

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:49.760
So this anxiety issue, it’s actually 
affecting two generations.  

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.360
Here’s the plot twist, this is from WHO, there’s now a World Anxiety Day,  

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:58.650
World Depression Day, even a 
World Mental Health Day.   

01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:04.860
WHO says the economic losses from 
mental health issues in companies  

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.310
are massive trillions of dollars.   

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:10.330
I forgot the exact number, but it’s 
easy to find from WHO.   

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:18.830
The main causes are anxiety in two groups: 
those born in the ’70s–’90s,   

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:22.860
and in Gen Z. Both are anxious, 
but about different things.   

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.610
Gen X is anxious about future uncertainty,

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.120
rising house prices.   

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.160
Gen Z is anxious about their career path.   

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.010
They’re worried, 
“What if I can’t ever buy a house?”  

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.140
So their defense mechanisms are different.   

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:45.120
Gen X tends to bottle things up.   

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.690
Gen Z is more vocal, they express it on 
social media and are more open.   

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:54.570
And what’s the outcome of anxiety? 
It lowers your quality of life.  

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:59.500
Anxiety is heavily influenced by two hormones: 
cortisol and adrenaline.   

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:05.500
When cortisol rises, it increases your
 risk of insulin resistance.   

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.850
Because we’re anxious, our sympathetic nervous system 
stays on, we’re constantly in “ready” mode. 

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.080
So our blood sugar goes up, 

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.400
blood pressure goes up, which ultimately leads to 

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.860
stroke and heart issues.   

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:24.970
Gen X’s anxiety comes from work stress   

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:30.190
high pressure, instability, the threat of 
getting fired, fights at home.   

01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:37.400
That’s why psychiatrists now mostly 
see either Gen X or Gen Z.   

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.490
So what about millennials?   

01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:43.290
Now this is interesting. Millennials are the 
most rebellious, the most vocal.   

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.170
Honestly, my generation is the 
most thoughtful   

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:52.810
and the most stubborn. 
So they think they’re fine.   

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.470
“Oh, whatever. It’s not a big deal.”   

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.120
So now we have a generation saying,  

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.600
“What’s your problem? So weak! I was raised…”   
Yup, that’s my generation. 

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.760
I won’t deny it. That’s my generation because I’m
 like that too, I used to think others were weaker.   

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.570
And now I get it, after hearing from 
my psychiatrist friends.   

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:18.280
There are two types of people who confide in them: 
Gen X parents with grown kids, and Gen Z.   

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.450
Gen Z’s anxiety comes from screen time.   

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:28.840
So friends out there, this is your 
cue to check yourself   

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.800
if you’re using an iPhone, go to settings,   

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.540
check your screen time, and look at 
your top three most-used apps.  

01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:41.100
I actually tested this on Pak Sandiaga. 
We had a conversation just like this, Pak.  

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:45.420
And guess what? 
His number one app was Zoom.   

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:47.560
I got him. 

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.810
 "Come on, Mr. Sandiaga."   

01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:53.680
How long was the Zoom? 
2 hours and 43 minutes.   

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.380
So it turns out, at his age, he spends
 his time in meetings.   

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.440
His life is meetings. Number two was
 WhatsApp. Three, finance.  

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.680
I don’t even know what finance app. I didn’t want to check. 
Social media was only number four.   

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.480
So all this time, it turns out Amin 
was handling the social media.   

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.170
And we only found out 
yesterday on stage.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.290
So if someone’s top three screen time apps 
are social media, that's a red flag.   

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:23.400
Because on social media,
 anyone can be anyone.  

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.640
You can craft your persona.   

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.496
But young people are still
 figuring out who they are, 

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:31.904
so they end up thinking, 
“Success must look like that.”  

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.200
Leads to anxiety.   

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:39.500
So if you want to reduce anxiety, limit your
 screen time on social media.  

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.530
And if it’s high, make sure it’s not social 
media that’s taking up most of it. 

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:48.800
If the highest is Zoom or a WhatsApp group,
 that means it’s for work.   

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.610
But if your top screen time is still social media,
 especially TikTok or short videos,   

01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:55.960
your attention span will go down.    

01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.880
This is a 2023 study for most young 
people, born between 1991 and 2010, 

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:07.000
our attention span has
 dropped to 8 seconds.   

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:12.250
So if a video doesn’t get its 
point across in 8 seconds   

01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:16.600
you’ve seen it, right, Pak Gita? Those Shorts
 or TikToks that pop up like:   

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:23.280
“Breaking news! Kidney failure from coffee? 
Find out now!”   

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.310
That hook has to hit in the first 9 seconds.    

01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.720
-That’s wild.    

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.510
-And if those first 9 seconds aren’t interesting    

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.840
-Scroll.
-Yes.

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.930
Turns out there's research behind that.   

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.240
Because of high screen time on social media,   

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.940
young people’s attention span is
 now down to 6.7 seconds.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:44.620
So if Endgame doesn’t 
open with a hook like:   

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:49.200
“Dr. Tirta! His life story in just... watch now!”   

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:52.960
But I see that Endgame still gets high views.

01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.850
That gives me hope. 
-Still hopeful.    

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.800
I see hope in this: A lot of people say,   

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.040
“TikTok is disruptive, it’s ruining
 young people.”   

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.560
But no, I still see hope. Why? 
I saw Dr. Felix, PhD,   

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.970
educating people on TikTok for 7 minutes 
and 30 seconds, 1 million views.   

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.880
I made a 3-minute health video, 2 million views.     

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.230
So there’s still hope. 
 -Yes. 

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:29.130
Meaning we, who have large followings   

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.680
and the intellectual ability to tell stories,

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.570
Let’s start talking: 
Limit screen time to 3 hours.    

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.080
And even if you hit 5 hours, 
make sure at least 30% of it 

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:49.400
is not social media.  Zoom, Kindle,
 e-books, anything else.    

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:56.590
If social media is your number one, 
your anxiety is going to get worse.    

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.720
Now Gen X is different, Pak. Gen X is
 funny, they have low screen time,   

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.690
but extremely high work stress.    

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.210
Their stress levels are super high, 
and their stress release is either 

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.760
super healthy or really unhealthy.   

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.680
The healthy ones go running, 
do ultramarathons  

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.944
Have you seen middle-aged men, 
55 years old, 

01:18:20.944 --> 01:18:24.760
suddenly hiking solo, biking for miles?

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.490
During the pandemic, so many
 were cycling.   

01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:27.790
- I know a few.

01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:34.220
- Or playing futsal. So Gen X either releases 
stress in very healthy ways, or not at all.  

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:39.630
Some eat lots of rich foods, they just love eating, 
what can you do? Some love traveling.    

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.530
I only recently realized-

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.320
I don’t know if any of your
 viewers are Gen X   

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.920
they carry heavy mental burdens
 but don’t talk about it.  

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.400
They’re used to bottling it up.    

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:59.050
They spend time fishing, going on solo 
trips, doing umrah multiple times,   

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:03.680
or staying at the mosque for a long time 
 because that’s where they can “talk”.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.690
They’re just not used to speaking openly.     

01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:06.800
They are both different. 

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.580
- Does that help reduce cortisol?   

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580
- It actually increases it, Pak.    

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.750
-Instead?
-Yes. 

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:18.650
That’s why many Gen X folks by 40, even if they 
exercise, they still suffer from heart issues. 

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.020
That’s from work stress.   

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:26.090
Their coworkers push them, 
“Come on, play football! You’re weak!”   

01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.520
Then, heart problems.   

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:33.560
 So in my opinion, men over 40  
 carry incredibly high work stress.   

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.380
Both men and women.     

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.620
-How do we reduce cortisol?    

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.820
-Stress release. Finding peace.   

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.480
Through spirituality, or meditation,
 both active and passive.   

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.880
I asked a meditation expert.   

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:54.400
The first type is active: exercise, 

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.130
yoga, pilates, hiking, eating.   

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:06.680
The second is passive: praying, or 
traditional meditation like in Bali.   

01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:11.630
That’s okay too.  I can’t expect Gen X, 

01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:13.760
who are 10 years older than me, 
to open up.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.320
It’s hard to get them to talk.   

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.920
They really don’t want to.   

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:23.500
Most of them DM me anonymously to vent.  

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.480
Their kids are already grown.   

01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:28.280
Their stress usually revolves 
around work or their kids.    

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.880
"Doc, what do I do? My kid doesn’t want
 to go to college. I’m so stressed.”   

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.040
That’s the kind of stuff they say, 
but never out loud.   

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:40.640
That’s why their health issues aren’t far from 
diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.    

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.640
Even if they don’t smoke or anything,
 it’s work stress.    

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.030
Now why is Gen Z’s suicide rate increasing?   
Stress from anxiety.   

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.620
 It’s overwhelming, isn’t it, Pak? Imagine being 
a psychiatrist with two massive patient groups.   

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:58.480
Millennials? We act like we’re tough. Because we’re in
 our most productive years right now.

01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:09.420
28 to 38, we’re in our peak career phase.  
 So we tend to power through things.      

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:14.600
-I’ve been meditating for the past 10 years.   

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.410
So every morning, after dawn prayers,
 I meditate.  

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:22.730
It really helps reduce cortisol.    

01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:30.010
- I’ve read the theory, but you’ve been practicing it.   
Well, it comes with wisdom with age.     

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:34.400
-Oh, one more thing,runners 
from Ethiopia and Kenya,  

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.360
I read that their hemoglobin levels 
are super high.   

01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:39.500
- That’s right.    

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:45.440
- It’s an anomaly, and that’s why
 they always win marathons.  

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.248
If I’m not mistaken, it already happened 
or will happen soon  

01:21:49.248 --> 01:21:50.990
A Kenyan or Ethiopian runner   

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:55.690
will break the 2-hour marathon barrier.     

01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:58.250
-Kipchoge did it recently, but with a pacer.    

01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.810
-Right.    

01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:08.240
So what can Indonesians do to 
increase hemoglobin levels?   

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:12.200
Since hemoglobin transports 
oxygen in the blood,   

01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:15.980
supplying the heart and 
everything else.    

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:24.620
In this era, we can engineer 
what we call Artificial Intelligence,   

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:32.220
we can even manipulate cells. I’m not talking 
eugenics, but within reasonable bounds,

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:36.270
What can we do to become more athletic?     

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:41.130
Okay. If we do genetic engineering,
 we’ll run into doping regulations.   

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.840
That’s what got Lance Armstrong in trouble.    

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.220
He used a substance to increase 
his hemoglobin.   

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.840
Ethiopian runners have high hemoglobin
 not just from running,   

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.820
but because they train at altitudes 
of 2,000 meters.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.760
Nairobi is over 2,000 meters above sea level. 

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:08.880
- So the theory is: If we want to improve 
the athletic performance

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.200
of runners, cyclists, athletes, football 
or basketball players   

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.920
their national training camps should
 be in high-altitude areas.    

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:22.840
That’s why one of the athletics 
camps is in Pengalengan.   

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:26.780
Because what stimulates hemoglobin production

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.440
is an adaptation process called homeostasis.    

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.880
Our body will adapt through homeostasis,   

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.190
and the training has to be in highlands.    

01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:40.510
There was a TikTok video that blew up, 
but in a positive way:  

01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:45.470
“I wore expensive shoes but still lost
 to a Rinjani porter in flip-flops.”    

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:46.960
They’ve got huge calves. 

01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:50.060
Because they’re adapted to 
their environment.   

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.000
We hike as a hobby, 
they do it for a living.    

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.980
No hike, no income.   

01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:00.300
They train at high altitude. 
Rinjani back and forth every day.    

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:05.020
For us, Rinjani is a challenge. 
For them, it’s just Tuesday.   

01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:09.640
So if you want to be like them,
 build the habits.   

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:15.980
And we, as a country, need to develop athletic
 training programs in high-altitude areas.    

01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.950
But still back to point two:

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:22.830
To produce quality teachers, 
there must be quality income.  

01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:25.760
There’s a lack of certainty in sports careers. 

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.360
So even after they peak and 
pass their golden years,   

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:34.030
not all of them get endorsements
 or brand deals.   

01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:38.430
From what I know, overseas,
I'm not sure, I'm not a runner  

01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:40.600
maybe Mas Agus Prayogo can answer this.   

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.560
From what I know, in developed countries,   

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.000
retired athletes are still managed 
by the government,   

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.580
so there's a sense of security.   

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.710
So parents are supportive if their 
kids want to become runners.   

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.360
They don't ask, "What are you going to
 eat when you retire?"  

01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:00.890
because it's already guaranteed.

01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:05.740
If there's financial security, we’ll see 
more top-tier talents emerge,

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.370
including football players.   

01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:10.910
Who said this? Was it Pak Edi?   

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:12.780
A former chairman of PSSI said,  

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:16.360
"Indonesia is not a player-producing 
country, it's a spectator country."  

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080
I laughed at that, Pak.  

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.360
Imagine, 280 million people, but we have
 less than 500,000 players.  

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.980
If I'm not mistaken, that was 
said by Pak Edi.   

01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:31.930
Pak Edi Rahmadi. I laughed at the time, 
but 8 years later, it turned out to be true.   

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.540
Why doesn't everyone want 
to be a football player?   

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.910
Because every time a kid dreams of becoming 
a football player, their parents say,   

01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:45.160
"Why become a football player? 
What will you eat after you retire?"   

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.540
It even became a movie called 
&lt;i&gt;Garuda di Dadaku.   &lt;/i&gt;

01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:52.110
A movie, and my kid watched it.  

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.190
There’s a scene where an old man says,  

01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:56.680
"Why become a football player? 
What are you going to eat?"   

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.690
Exactly.   

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.280
So it’s true, if we could guarantee an 
athlete’s livelihood after retirement,   

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.440
there would be so many worthy kids.   

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:11.480
Because I’ve seen it firsthand, 
So many worthy athletes   

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:17.310
don’t go pro, they go to college instead, 
because they or their parents think 

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.870
that’s what will earn them money.  

01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:28.410
Running is going viral. It’s actually been
 popular for a while, but it keeps rising.   

01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:36.830
This is a great opportunity for the government, 
"Let’s ensure the athletes' livelihoods are secured."   

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.890
Then we’ll see progress.   

01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:42.600
Japan won the 2018 Boston Marathon.   

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.560
And the reason is simple: they have the Hakone Ekiden,   

01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:48.940
a prestigious university-level competition.  

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.560
Japanese players like Endo and friends, 
who beat our national team,   

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.200
come from university competitions.   

01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:02.320
And from what I know,   
the best talent pipeline 

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.340
still belongs to Mas Azrul Ananda, 
DBL (Developmental Basketball League).   

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:10.880
DBL is my role model in sports 
management and business.   

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.560
He runs DBL so well that it produces
 amazing talents,   

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.390
and most DBL players end up in the IBL 
and even join the national team.   

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.130
In my opinion, if the DBL system 
 is implemented well,   

01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:29.870
then this is the kind of certainty the government
 must build, so there’s a reliable pathway   

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:32.970
for athletes, so parents across Indonesia   

01:27:32.970 --> 01:27:37.740
won’t be afraid to let their children 
become teachers or athletes.   

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.470
Back to financial matters, Sir.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.590
-Tirta, we’ve talked about so 
many things already.   

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.440
-Yes.

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.070
-Lastly, let’s talk a bit about 
business, entrepreneurship.  

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.900
-Oh man, don’t, because Pak Gita 
teaches that stuff.  

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:56.360
-I’m curious about your view 
on Indonesian startups.   

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.820
-We’ve already discussed it a bit-
how do you see  

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.290
-Is it okay, Pak Gita?   

01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.270
-Go ahead, please.   

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:05.000
-Because you’re the real expert on this.  

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.560
-No, I’d like to hear your view.  

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:18.440
-I actually have this itch, honestly. There’s this
 question that came up on social media.   

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.420
So there was this tweet that really 
stuck with me on X.   

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.960
I don’t know if the account 
was anonymous or real.   

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:32.200
"Why is it that my generation, people my age,
 don’t last long when leading startups?"   

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.280
That became a question for me. 
Why is it that people 

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:42.360
born in the '90s, '85 to '90, 
when leading a company,   

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.960
don’t last long? 
What’s wrong with us?   

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.230
After I talked with some lecturers  

01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:53.900
and I don’t just ask away
 when I’m confused 

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:59.840
I asked ChatGPT with a well-written prompt, 
and it said: lack of management 

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.770
skills, people management  too 
general, too theoretical.   

01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:06.830
Then I asked my lecturers, and their 
answers were more practical:  

01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:10.120
there’s no clear career path
 in those companies.  

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.040
They hire people based on networks.   

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:18.960
That’s the answer from my circle of educators, 
though not representing any campus.   

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.080
They said it’s because there’s no 
meritocracy or technocracy.   

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.260
That’s what my lecturers said.   

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.760
And my peers also said it’s because 
in some companies,   

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.230
they value trust and loyalty to 
friends and networks.

01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:41.240
You might have someone who’s smart 
but put in the wrong position,   

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.280
so they don’t perform, don’t look good, 
so they seem incompetent.   

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:52.140
Meanwhile someone less capable is placed in
a role that suits them, so they perform well.   

01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:57.630
That becomes a problem.   

01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:01.640
Putting the wrong person
 in the wrong place.   

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.680
Hiring not based on capability, 
but prioritizing networks.   

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:12.300
When in fact, networks are 
for finding investors.

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.980
For me, networking is useful when
 we’re building a big company,  

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.400
a partnership, or some big venture.   

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.860
But here, networks are being 
used to hire people.   

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.660
So the talent acquisition is
 based on networks.   

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.720
It should be the BOD 
(Board of Directors)   

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.580
who handles networking.   

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:35.660
But instead, talent acquisition is done through 
networking, not based on capabilities,

01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:40.590
what someone has actually done. And we view 
capability only in terms of academics.   

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:46.860
When we should be open to the fact that
 even if someone’s academic credentials   

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.470
aren’t great, but their experience
 is solid, they’re still qualified.   

01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:53.900
And fourth, we tend to limit 
things by age, it’s annoying.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:00.730
That’s what ends up with unqualified
 leaders leading companies

01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:06.460
too soon. Why? Because there's
 an age limit of 25.   

01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:08.280
How does that work?   

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.120
Max age 25, minimum 4 years of experience.   

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:18.090
Wait, does that mean you 
graduated at 21? Accelerated?   

01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:24.750
Because of this age restriction, 
someone aged 35 to 40 can’t get in,   

01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:29.870
even if they’re actually a great fit. Meanwhile someone
 who’s not ready, gets the job. It's a mess. 

01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:31.920
That’s what causes startups to crash.   

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:36.200
Maybe it’s not even the leader’s fault, 
but poor delegation.   

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.710
The chain from top to bottom doesn’t work. 
So what’s the solution?   

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:43.470
Again, stop hiring based on age.   

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.270
If you want your startup to succeed, 
cut back on age-based recruitment.   

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.280
Because it keeps great talents, 
who just happen to be 35  

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.220
out of the picture.   

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:58.300
"But Doc, they’re not up to date?" 
Not necessarily. With today’s technology,  

01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.100
someone 35 or 45 can totally learn.   

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.680
If you limit by age, 
you’ll end up hiring

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.790
people who don’t have 
enough experience.   

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:12.090
And secondly, please hire people  
 based on capability.   

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.350
Don’t just say,

01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:21.210
"He's in in, he’s my college 
buddy, I trust him."   

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.720
Are we really hiring someone 
 because they were our college friend?   

01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:27.960
Or because they’re my dad’s neighbor?   

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.370
No. That’s not right.   

01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:31.870
That’s why there was this plot twist, 
a mind-blowing comment 

01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:35.690
I forgot who said it, was it an account
 called PNS Ababil or something?   

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.880
The best recruitment system is 
actually civil service—PNS.   

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:43.440
Really. The best method. We don’t know 
what goes on behind the scenes.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.140
-But it’s tested.   

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.200
-Yeah, everyone takes the same test.   

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.330
And in the end, the best talent is chosen.   

01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:55.050
The best method is actually the
 civil servant system.   

01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:59.720
Because everyone is tested using the same method, 
regardless of where you graduated from.  

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.670
They test you and then assign you, 
"Oh, you're suited for this, let’s place you here."  

01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:04.220
It’s actually a good system, Sir. 

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.320
-I often say this when we look at it,

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.280
Income per capita growth in Southeast Asia   

01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:17.440
compared to China 

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:23.930
over the past 30 years, Southeast Asia 
has grown only 2.7 times.   

01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:26.060
China, 10 times.   

01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:30.060
-Yeah, I saw that graph, 
it’s exponential, right?  

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:36.090
-Exactly. And China pulled ahead of Southeast 
Asia because of four things.   

01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:42.170
First, investment in education. Second, 
investment in infrastructure.   

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:48.480
Third, governance, 
connecting talent with power.   

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.720
Fourth, competitiveness.   

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:55.600
We already talked about education.   
Now let’s talk about meritocracy.

01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:00.030
In Southeast Asia, the 
tendency is to hire  

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.150
based more on patronage and/or
 loyalty than merit.   

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.600
-Wow, yeah.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.160
-In China, it’s strict.  
 If your IQ is 70, you’re out.   

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.580
-Even if you’re the boss’s kid.   

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.670
-Exactly. Whether you're someone’s 
child or partner, doesn’t matter.   

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:22.860
But in other countries,  
 non-academic or 

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.460
non-intellectual factors are heavily considered.   

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:32.910
But to be fair, the talent pool is limited   

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.490
because education is also limited 
in Southeast Asia, right?   

01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:40.520
We already talked about it earlier 
 roughly 90% of households

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.120
don’t have a bachelor’s degree.   

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.760
So how do we build the kind of 
culture you experienced?  

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.640
To me, it’s a chicken-and-egg problem. 
 We want to find meritocracy,   

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:55.080
but we also need to increase the supply, 
more educational output.   

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.300
So how do you see this moving forward?   

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.120
-It’s tough, like being a lecturer.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.880
I didn’t expect this, but this 
podcast really got me thinking.  

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.620
The first answer is, let me start with 
the worst-case scenario, sir.  

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.870
It’ll happen in the medical field because
 our complaints are so high,   

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:20.110
there’s already a narrative about 
bringing in foreign doctors.   

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.820
So because we can’t produce them  for the 
government or the Minister of Health,  

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.160
maybe we can’t produce doctors that meet their standards,   

01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:33.180
so the instant way to fill that talent gap 
is by bringing them from abroad.   

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.600
- Are you open to that concept?   

01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:37.870
- I’m open to all points of view, sir.   

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:42.380
Going back to what I learned from my 
father, every mirror has two sides.   

01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:45.800
If I get stuck on one side, I won’t be 
able to understand the other.  

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.520
So maybe the Minister of Health sees 
it from a managerial point of view,   

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.870
because his background
 is as a bank CEO.   

01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:55.370
So he’ll view growth through 
the lens of talent.   

01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:59.950
Doctors are used to a 
decade-plus of education,   

01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:03.800
so producing doctors quickly 
is just not feasible. 

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:10.200
- This is real, China has 4.5 million doctors.  

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:12.160
- Huh? 
- 4.5 million.   

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:15.280
Meanwhile in Indonesia, if I’m not 
mistaken, it’s only 250,000.  

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:20.600
If we do the math based on population,   

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.210
we should proportionally 
be well above 250,000. 

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.590
-That’s the classic supply-demand,
 chicken-and-egg case.  

01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:30.110
If you want great doctors, you’ve got to 
produce them domestically.   

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.030
But training proper doctors in 
Indonesia takes 15–20 years.  

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:37.040
So he, as the policymaker,  

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.710
as a manager who makes 
and oversees policy,   

01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:43.610
is naturally going to meet resistance.
 That’s one. 

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.480
The second is the foreign teacher narrative 
 that just came up two days ago,  

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.250
I think it was from Prof. Stella, right?   

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.280
Same deal, since we can’t fulfill the talent needs, just 
bring them in. But again, it’s just a narrative so far.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.120
So here’s the worst-case scenario,

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:02.940
if we keep recruiting people 
through networks  

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.960
when networking is supposed 
to be a skill used when 

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.760
negotiating with clients but it ends up 
being used to fill talent gaps.   

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:16.030
Large multinational companies 
coming into Indonesia  

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.930
because of open investment policies that 

01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:20.410
if I’m not mistaken, you have 
mentioned in your lectures 

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:24.060
If Indonesia wants to grow,   
we need to welcome as much 

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.650
foreign investment as possible.  

01:37:26.650 --> 01:37:28.330
But if that can’t be achieved, it’s tough.   

01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:32.270
How can they operate here if our local 
talent doesn’t meet their needs?   

01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:34.920
So they set up a site here,
 but all the talent is from abroad.   

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.510
That’s the worst-case scenario.  

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.900
And in the end, we just can’t-

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:46.650
-In principle, I actually support the 
Minister of Health’s approach.  

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.580
-Okay.

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:53.560
- Let’s say there’s a disease 
in Sumedang   

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.210
that only a medical expert
 from Sudan can cure.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:02.480
We should be open to bringing 
that doctor here, right?  

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.200
As long as we don’t have the necessary
 expertise locally to treat the illness

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.150
anywhere, not just Sumedang.   

01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:17.950
That concept should also apply in 
other contexts, like education.   

01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:25.390
If we want to train students in Tarakan 
to become physics experts,   

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:30.090
and there’s no physics expert there,
 and none available in Jakarta either,  

01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:33.310
then we need to be open to bringing 
one in from anywhere.   

01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:36.680
That’s what we call the 
democratization of ideas.   

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:42.590
And it’s a kind of pragmatism that’s
 very real in Singapore.   

01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:48.680
If they have a broken toilet, they ask, 

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:54.320
“Who in the world can fix this efficiently?”

01:38:55.740 --> 01:39:00.670
And if nobody in Singapore 
can, they’ll hire

01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:06.280
a toilet expert from wherever, 
Norway, Ethiopia, Solo  

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.830
as long as that person can 
be held accountable  

01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:10.830
as a real expert who can get 
the job done.   

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.230
That’s openness.  

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:18.510
- Exactly. That’s a point of view 
I’ve come around to.   

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:20.650
I was resistant to it four years ago.  

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:28.670
- As long as we understand that the
 long-term goal   is for these experts 

01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:31.660
to transfer their knowledge 
 to local people.  

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:35.740
- So aside from hiring them,
 they also transfer knowledge.  

01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:38.520
The knowledge management aspect 
has to be clear, right? 

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:48.110
Exactly. We can’t hide behind the blanket 
of nationalism without actually 

01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:52.030
curing the sick or educating 
the uneducated. 

01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:59.290
So there are two steps: we create a 
roadmap for knowledge management 

01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:03.770
or transfer; we recruit the 
best foreign talent   

01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:07.420
to temporarily fill the gap.   

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:12.350
At the same time, these experts must agree 
to transfer their knowledge to us.   

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:12.810
-Yes.

01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:17.150
- So when their contracts end, our local talent 
is ready, and the roadmap is implemented. 

01:40:17.150 --> 01:40:20.080
- Exactly. And once we’re ready,
 we can close the door.  

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.380
- That’s the solution with the least risk.   

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:27.720
- I used to be resistant too, Pak Gita. 
I totally agree now.  

01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:32.460
Back then I made decisions based 
purely on idealism.   

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.480
Now I use fishbone analysis,
 Ishikawa diagram  

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.810
to make decisions with the least risk.   

01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:40.810
And I think this has the least risk. 

01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:47.440
-Nationalism should manifest 
in national resilience.   

01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:52.890
And national resilience can 
only be sustained if we’re

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:58.240
capable, healthy, educated, cultured,   

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:05.340
civilized, communicative,  
and informed. 

01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:09.310
-So I’d revise my earlier opinion, 
foreign talent 

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:13.440
isn’t just a worst-case scenario. It could 
actually be a big advantage for us. 

01:41:13.710 --> 01:41:18.030
- Absolutely. It’s empirical. I’ve seen 
it even in China.   

01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:20.430
How they're being open. 

01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:24.010
Back in 1978, Deng Xiaoping began reforms.   

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.610
Part of that was welcoming foreign investors   

01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:32.830
with the goal of transferring technology.   

01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:35.180
-78?
-78.

01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:38.080
Mao Zedong had died just
 1–2 years before that,   

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.920
then Deng took over and launched reforms.   

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.790
That’s when China’s era of openness began.   

01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:50.680
Now they’ve achieved technological
 supremacy.   

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.240
They spent the past 30 years
 learning from America, Japan, 

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.490
Korea, Europe, and now the roles have reversed.

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.320
- So Korea was the same? 
During the reforms in 1988–1992?   

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:03.920
-Oh, yes.

01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:05.630
-Japan too, around 1976.

01:42:05.630 --> 01:42:07.950
- Under Park Chung-hee and others.   

01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:12.840
But I think it’s not easy to shift 
the mindset in Indonesia

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.880
toward openness.   

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:21.480
Still, I truly believe in the
 democratization of ideas.   

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:28.490
If there are no ideas in a place, then open the 
doors and let those ideas come in

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.560
from anywhere. 

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:36.300
- This is really interesting. Maybe if my doctor
 friends heard it directly from you, 

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.570
they’d instantly understand the point of view.   

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.010
Seriously.   

01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:45.770
Because to be honest, Pak Gita, 
in healthcare services,

01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:53.720
it’s harder dealing with 30 medical
 specialists than 30 patients.   

01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:59.310
Because each specialist wants to be heard.   

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.770
So I feel like instead of the Minister 
of Health explaining this,

01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:06.440
it’d be better if you told 
them directly.   

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.080
It’s really compelling, and I do agree
 with the perspective.  

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:12.650
I even spoke to some doctor
 friends about it.   

01:43:13.710 --> 01:43:16.920
They asked, 
“Are you pro-Minister of Health?” 

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:20.190
It’s not about being pro or anti. 
Let me explain the POV.   

01:43:20.190 --> 01:43:22.730
The Minister is making policy from 
a managerial perspective.   

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.790
Okay, he’s not a doctor. So we understand 
he views it from a management angle,

01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:31.870
and he was brought in to handle the
 health system. That’s clear.   

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:38.160
As a healthcare practitioner, it just so happens
 that the BOD is in a managerial role. 

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.670
The conflict lies in the pace of change. 

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.130
You want gradual change, 
while they want it fast. 

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.640
So what should be done? 
You have to meet halfway. 

01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:55.630
If both of them are in the BOD 
and you’re the executor, 

01:43:55.630 --> 01:43:57.290
and nobody wants to meet in 
the middle, it’s tough.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:03.600
Because change will inevitably 
happen, no matter what. 

01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.420
Now, the difficult part is, those who want 
to change are usually young doctors, 

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:12.750
because they’re more open 
with my generation. 

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:14.620
My generation is now becoming specialists.

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:17.280
It’s only been 3 or 4 years, those
 I often invite to my podcast 

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:21.480
that generation is now becoming 
specialists, and they’re more open. 

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:25.080
-Yes. I saw the one with the urology expert. 

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.910
-Yes, Dr. Wisda. When he educates,
 it’s very plot-twist-y. 

01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:31.424
He never forbids patients 
from doing anything. 

01:44:31.424 --> 01:44:33.050
He always says, “It’s okay, as long 
as it’s not excessive.” 

01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:34.990
That’s totally different from 
doctors in the old days. 

01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:37.980
Now, the doctors who are resistant, 
we can’t blame them either. 

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:43.790
That’s why if the Minister wants this to go 
smoothly, he has to sit in the middle. 

01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:45.960
It’s a triangle of assets within a company. 

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:51.260
So as policymakers, the Commission 9, the doctors,

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.310
but they all have big egos. 

01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:56.240
Because no one wants to meet in
 the middle, well, this is the result.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.690
It’s like in a company let’s say you and I. 

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.720
You hire a consultant, maybe McKinsey or PwC, 

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.620
to make changes. I resist eventually, 
the company collapses. 

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:13.310
And this keeps happening with BPJS. 
BPJS is already bleeding. 

01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:15.850
It just so happens the director
 used to be my former dean, 

01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:20.650
Mr. Gufron. So yeah, it keeps bleeding.
 If we keep bleeding, 

01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:24.030
it’s tough. Hospitals might not 
be able to pay their bills.

01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:26.280
That’s why this must be addressed immediately, 

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.370
both from the BPJS side, meaning healthcare 
service financial management, 

01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:34.680
insurance, or in terms of talent management, 
and that’s a chicken-and-egg problem. 

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:41.070
And what can we do? If we 
go back to startups,

01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:43.640
it turns out what my professor
 said was true. 

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.720
Meritocracy is very difficult to 
implement here. Our culture 

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.000
has always been to recruit people we trust, 
based on loyalty. What’s the term? 

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
-Patronage and/or loyalty. 

01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:56.200
-Yes, patronage and loyalty. 
You're like a professor. 

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:59.160
The last time I met Bu Yuni Ros, she said, 

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.220
“Don’t ever, Tirta, recruit someone…” 
this is her actual quote. 

01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:08.830
“I get really upset when people recruit 
just because they’re friends. 

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:11.420
A company once collapsed 
because of that.” 

01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:16.860
She ranted about it in class. And you 
are the second person who said that.

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.400
Two of my teachers said the 
same thing so it must be true. 

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.260
So the problem in Indonesian companies
 is hiring the wrong people, 

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:26.700
setting age limits, and not creating 
a clear career path. 

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.380
And when I joined Unilever, 

01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:31.530
I joined Unilever and United Tractors recently, 

01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:35.550
for the first time, as a consultant. 

01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:38.960
Their meritocracy is amazing, I admit. 

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:41.790
At Unilever, the meritocracy is excellent. 

01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:45.790
And funnily enough, if we look at 
Unilever’s financial statement, 

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.770
their biggest expense is for
 knowledge management. 

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.980
-Knowledge management, research 
and development. 

01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.280
-Yes, their budget is massive for that. 

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:58.400
They don’t hesitate to spend on those things. 

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.500
And UT, United Tractors, also allocates 
budget for that. 

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:07.520
That’s when I realized why these companies
 remain stable for 30 or 40 years. 

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.870
Because their meritocracy is clear. 

01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:12.780
Maybe their salaries aren’t as big 
as tech startups, 

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:18.380
but their career paths, knowledge structure,
 and recruitment process are all clear.

01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:22.680
That’s something we millennials 
need to work on. 

01:47:23.690 --> 01:47:25.760
Gen X turns out to not be 
so wrong after all. 

01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:30.430
Because we used to think Gen X was wrong.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.610
“Why are you so ambitious about your careers?” 

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:36.730
Well, they’re the ones making 
the policies and it’s neat.

01:47:37.690 --> 01:47:41.000
And we’re too ambitious, trying to
 handle everything ourselves, 

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.800
while the ones with solid networks 
are the baby boomers. 

01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:48.360
Turns out Gen X is actually the 
game-changer, in my opinion. 

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.880
So people born in the ’70s to ’80s 

01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:55.150
are now the ones worthy of becoming leaders, 

01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:57.610
In my opinion. ’70s to ’80s. 

01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:01.870
The president is a baby boomer. 
The vice president is a millennial. 

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.360
No Gen X in the top leadership yet. 

01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:06.220
-Let’s hope. 

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:12.810
-I really hope that Gen X will be given 
the chance to lead 

01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:17.800
I think the meritocracy would be clearer, because 
they might be more capable of ensuring that. 

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:21.280
From the five companies I’ve worked with, 

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.110
most of their leaders are Gen X, 
and they are clear. 

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.950
I don’t know why they manage to live frugally, 
their social media accounts are private 

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:36.720
Gen X right now- 
I actually want to ask you,

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.300
why aren’t Gen X leading yet? 

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.440
Can I ask that? Is that okay? 

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.750
-Of course. I just haven’t really thought about it. 

01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:49.230
-So those born in the ’70s are now what, 54?

01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:50.010
-In their 50s. 

01:48:50.010 --> 01:48:55.160
-Yeah. People born in the ’70s to ’80s 
should be in leadership now. 

01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:03.600
-But if they’re not that active on social media,
 that might actually be a positive trait. 

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.400
-Yeah, they’re really low-profile. 

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.490
-And if they’re firm about hiring based on
 meritocracy, that’s an incredible attribute. 

01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:17.390
That’s the kind of leader we’ll need going 
forward whether male or female 

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:21.740
who firmly chooses based on meritocracy.

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:28.350
Not just in government, but also in 
entrepreneurship, in academia, everywhere. 

01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:33.720
Right now, we’re in an era saturated with

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.030
festivalization or sensationalism,
 lacking intellectualization. 

01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:43.000
That’s what should be prioritized. 
That’s why conversations like this 

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.360
hopefully they’ll be part of the
 intellectualization process. 

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.670
-This is valuable knowledge for me, honestly. 
I’ve learned so much. 

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.020
In fact, I’m becoming more certain because
 my dream has shifted. 

01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:57.520
I haven’t told you about this yet.

01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:00.990
My ultimate goal now is to keep 
studying, I want to teach. 

01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:05.530
I’m currently at UGM. I’m helping out
 with public relations at UGM. 

01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:09.640
I’m also a guest lecturer at two campuses. 

01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:13.150
So it turns out I might have the privilege 
when it comes to income. 

01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:18.960
I know that lecturer salaries in Indonesia
 aren’t as good as in Finland or Germany, 

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.920
but I have the privilege to share knowledge
 without worrying about income. 

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.880
-You should think about how 
you can teach abroad too. 

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.690
Guest lecture.

01:50:27.690 --> 01:50:29.760
-That’s hard.

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.600
-No, because your storytelling is extraordinary. 

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.160
You should be able to tell stories 
abroad about Indonesia. 

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.630
That’s nationalism. 

01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:45.550
-I’ve never done it. Once I got the chance 
during undergrad, and I turned it down. 

01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:47.290
-Well, God willing, the opportunity
 will come again. 

01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:51.050
-That’s my biggest regret when I buried that dream. 
-It’ll come again. 

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.310
Believe it. It’ll come. 

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:59.280
Tirta, it’s been almost two hours. 
Any final messages for our friends? 

01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:04.040
My message... 

01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:07.200
-Here’s my message to my peers, okay?
 I always base it on age. 

01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:13.470
To those born between ’85 and ’95, 
who are now in the career-building phase, 

01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:17.520
I’m sure you either have a little
 child or are still child-free. 

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.930
If you have money, use it for these two things: 

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:27.180
The most important investments aren’t bank
 deposits. Those are important, sure. 

01:51:27.808 --> 01:51:33.370
Stocks are important too. But before buying gold, 
spend your money on knowledge and health. 

01:51:33.370 --> 01:51:35.260
In my opinion, these aren’t expenses.

01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:39.290
You’ll never regret spending 
money on those two. 

01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:43.310
Medical checkups, exercise, education, because 
you’ll reap the benefits 10 years from now. 

01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:47.660
Trust me, if you were born between 
’85 and ’95. That’s for you. 

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:51.370
For my younger bros born after ’96. 

01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:55.280
Those born in ’96 or ’97 are in an awkward spot,
 too old for Gen Z, too young for millennials. 

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.730
Be whatever you want. 

01:51:56.730 --> 01:52:01.120
But to the Gen Z folks younger 
than me, you’re smarter than me. 

01:52:01.530 --> 01:52:03.950
Honestly. You’re smarter than me. 

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:07.660
At ITB, I met some of you who were 
more ambitious, had higher GPAs, 

01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:10.220
and better soft skills than I do. 

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:15.240
You’re generally better at Orange,
 Tableau, Power BI than I am.

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.400
Use technology for something meaningful. 

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:22.860
Job-hopping is okay. So you're not
 loyal to one company. 

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.780
But that doesn’t mean rigid 
systems are wrong. 

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.380
This is for you: 

01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:34.350
Sometimes the rigid, fixed structures 
are what provide clarity. 

01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:39.020
If you keep changing, it’ll lead to 
instability later in life, say, at 35,

01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:41.630
and we’ll be too tired to keep 
changing as we get older. 

01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:44.250
So use tech for good. 

01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:46.810
And if you want to job-hop for 
experience, go ahead

01:52:46.810 --> 01:52:50.400
but eventually you’ll find a stable 
company to settle into. 

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:54.540
Now, this is for my seniors, 
my older generation, Gen X. 

01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:00.090
You’re now probably in your 
50s, 45, 50, or 55. 

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:04.620
Believe me, dreams don’t 
end with numbers. 

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:08.250
So if you feel your career is stuck,

01:53:08.250 --> 01:53:14.720
 that you never made it to BOD, 
only got to senior manager 

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:18.800
that’s okay. But remember, your life and 
death only happen once. 

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.280
So I want to say this to
 those in their 50s 

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:25.980
because I have team members
 in their 50s. 

01:53:26.490 --> 01:53:30.970
My driver. I got him to start
 running 6 kilometers. 

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:32.540
And that was a small change. 

01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:36.380
So to you Gen X folks, small 
changes are positive. 

01:53:37.210 --> 01:53:42.330
Change doesn’t have to be big. You don’t 
have to resign or go big. No. 

01:53:42.330 --> 01:53:45.820
But at least, death comes once,
 but we live many times. 

01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:49.210
So at the very least, you can live 
again the next day.

01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:52.760
Appreciate small things. 

01:53:53.370 --> 01:53:55.960
Don’t only appreciate big milestones. 
For example, 

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.600
“I have to be successful because I own land.” 

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:02.320
“I have to be successful because I bought 
a house for my two kids.” No. 

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.540
Small things matter too. 

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:09.480
Maybe you’re overlooking small things, 
and that’s what makes life feel tangled. 

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:12.510
If your career is stuck, 

01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:16.080
use that as a chance to 
explore something else. 

01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:20.000
Even if the profit is just 7 million rupiah 
a month or 5 million,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.410
At least you’ll experience what 
running a business feels like. 

01:54:22.410 --> 01:54:25.840
Or at least experience something 
new, even if it’s small. 

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:26.880
That’s the third. 

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.780
And I hope you won’t be stingy with 
knowledge toward my generation 

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:33.880
because we need to collaborate. 

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:39.690
And to Mr. Gita you are my 
mother’s idol, my father’s idol. 

01:54:39.690 --> 01:54:43.470
My parents talk about you all the time. 

01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:46.730
My colleagues at the office 
watch your podcast. 

01:54:47.530 --> 01:54:49.840
It’s a huge honor for me to be here. 

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:52.120
I usually watch your Stanford lectures 

01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.240
-You're welcome. 

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.360
-In English, and they’re really hard.

01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:02.570
This is one this is a privilege 
I might never get again. 

01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:05.160
So I promise myself, and you, Mr. Gita, 

01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.920
the knowledge I’ve gained here,
 I will share it with my friends. 

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:10.840
And with the public. 

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.520
-Thank you so much, Tirta.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:17.210
Everyone, that was Dr. Tirta Mandira Hudhi. 

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.410
Thank you.
